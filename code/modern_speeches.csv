178, State of the Union Address, Richard Nixon,1970-01-22,  mr speaker mr president my colleagues in the congress our distinguished guests and my fellow americans  to address a joint session of the congress in this great chamber in which i was once privileged to serve is an honor for which i am deeply grateful  the state of the union address is traditionally an occasion for a lengthy and detailed account by the president of what he has accomplished in the past what he wants the congress to do in the future and in an election year to lay the basis for the political issues which might be decisive in the fall  occasionally there comes a time when profound and farreaching events command a break with tradition this is such a time  i say this not only because 1970 marks the beginning of a new decade in which america will celebrate its 200th birthday i say it because new knowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both our programs and our institutions in america need to be reformed  the moment has arrived to harness the vast energies and abundance of this land to the creation of a new american experience an experience richer and deeper and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human spirit  the seventies will be a time of new beginnings a time of exploring both on the earth and in the heavens a time of discovery but the time has also come for emphasis on developing better ways of managing what we have and of completing what mans genius has begun but left unfinished  our land this land that is ours together is a great and a good land it is also an unfinished land and the challenge of perfecting it is the summons of the seventies  it is in that spirit that i address myself to those great issues facing our nation which are above partisanship  when we speak of americas priorities the first priority must always be peace for america and the world  the major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to the war in vietnam in a way that our generation will be remembered not so much as the generation that suffered in war but more for the fact that we had the courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next generation was able to keep  we are making progress toward that goal  the prospects for peace are far greater today than they were a year ago  a major part of the credit for this development goes to the members of this congress who despite their differences on the conduct of the war have overwhelmingly indicated their support of a just peace by this action you have completely demolished the enemys hopes that they can gain in washington the victory our fighting men have denied them in vietnam  no goal could be greater than to make the next generation the first in this century in which america was at peace with every nation in the world  i shall discuss in detail the new concepts and programs designed to achieve this goal in a separate report on foreign policy which i shall submit to the congress at a later date  today let me describe the directions of our new policies  we have based our policies on an evaluation of the world as it is not as it was 25 years ago at the conclusion of world war ii many of the policies which were necessary and right then are obsolete today  then because of americas overwhelming military and economic strength because of the weakness of other major free world powers and the inability of scores of newly independent nations to defend or even govern themselves america had to assume the major burden for the defense of freedom in the world  in two wars first in korea and now in vietnam we furnished most of the money most of the arms most of the men to help other nations defend their freedom  today the great industrial nations of europe as well as japan have regained their economic strength and the nations of latin americaand many of the nations who acquired their freedom from colonialism after world war ii in asia and africahave a new sense of pride and dignity and a determination to assume the responsibility for their own defense  that is the basis of the doctrine i announced at guam  neither the defense nor the development of other nations can be exclusively or primarily an american undertaking  the nations of each part of the world should assume the primary responsibility for their own wellbeing and they themselves should determine the terms of that wellbeing  we shall be faithful to our treaty commitments but we shall reduce our involvement and our presence in other nations affairs  to insist that other nations play a role is not a retreat from responsibility it is a sharing of responsibility  the result of this new policy has been not to weaken our alliances but to give them new life new strength a new sense of common purpose  relations with our european allies are once again strong and healthy based on mutual consultation and mutual responsibility  we have initiated a new approach to latin america in which we deal with those nations as partners rather than patrons  the new partnership concept has been welcomed in asia we have developed an historic new basis for japaneseamerican friendship and cooperation which is the linchpin for peace in the pacific  if we are to have peace in the last third of the century a major factor will be the development of a new relationship between the united states and the soviet union  i would not underestimate our differences but we are moving with precision and purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation  our negotiations on strategic arms limitations and in other areas will have far greater chance for success if both sides enter them motivated by mutual selfinterest rather than naive sentimentality  it is with this same spirit that we have resumed discussions with communist china in our talks at warsaw  our concern in our relations with both these nations is to avoid a catastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement of our differences  i would be the last to suggest that the road to peace is not difficult and dangerous but i believe our new policies have contributed to the prospect that america may have the best chance since world war ii to enjoy a generation of uninterrupted peace and that chance will be enormously increased if we continue to have a relationship between congress and the executive in which despite differences in detail where the security of america and the peace of mankind are concerned we act not as republicans not as democrats but as americans  as we move into the decade of the seventies we have the greatest opportunity for progress at home of any people in world history  our gross national product will increase by 500 billion in the next 10 years this increase alone is greater than the entire growth of the american economy from 1790 to 1950  the critical question is not whether we will grow but how we will use that growth  the decade of the sixties was also a period of great growth economically but in that same 10year period we witnessed the greatest growth of crime the greatest increase in inflation the greatest social unrest in america in 100 years never has a nation seemed to have had more and enjoyed it less  at heart the issue is the effectiveness of government  ours has becomeas it continues to be and should remaina society of large expectations government helped to generate these expectations it undertook to meet them yet increasingly it proved unable to do so  as a people we had too many visionsand too little vision  now as we enter the seventies we should enter also a great age of reform of the institutions of american government  our purpose in this period should not be simply better management of the programs of the past the time has come for a new questa quest not for a greater quantity of what we have but for a new quality of life in america  a major part of the substance for an unprecedented advance in this nations approach to its problems and opportunities is contained in more than two score legislative proposals which i sent to the congress last year and which still await enactment  i will offer at least a dozen more major programs in the course of this session  at this point i do not intend to go through a detailed listing of what i have proposed or will propose but i would like to mention three areas in which urgent priorities demand that we move and move now  first we cannot delay longer in accomplishing a total reform of our welfare system when a system penalizes work breaks up homes robs recipients of dignity there is no alternative to abolishing that system and adopting in its place the program of income support job training and work incentives which i recommended to the congress last year  second the time has come to assess and reform all of our institutions of government at the federal state and local level it is time for a new federalism in which after 190 years of power flowing from the people and local and state governments to washington dc it will begin to flow from washington back to the states and to the people of the united states  third we must adopt reforms which will expand the range of opportunities for all americans we can fulfill the american dream only when each person has a fair chance to fulfill his own dreams this means equal voting rights equal employment opportunity and new opportunities for expanded ownership because in order to be secure in their human rights people need access to property rights  i could give similar examples of the need for reform in our programs for health education housing transportation as well as other critical areas which directly affect the wellbeing of millions of americans  the people of the united states should wait no longer for these reforms that would so deeply enhance the quality of their life  when i speak of actions which would be beneficial to the american people i can think of none more important than for the congress to join this administration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of living  now i realize it is tempting to blame someone else for inflation some blame business for raising prices some blame unions for asking for more wages  but a review of the stark fiscal facts of the 1960s clearly demonstrates where the primary blame for rising prices must be placed  in the decade of the sixties the federal government spent 57 billion more than it took in in taxes  in that same decade the american people paid the bill for that deficit in price increases which raised the cost of living for the average family of four by 200 per month in america  now millions of americans are forced to go into debt today because the federal government decided to go into debt yesterday we must balance our federal budget so that american families will have a better chance to balance their family budgets  only with the cooperation of the congress can we meet this highest priority objective of responsible government we are on the right track  we had a balanced budget in 1969 this administration cut more than 7 billion out of spending plans in order to produce a surplus in 1970 and in spite of the fact that congress reduced revenues by 3 billion i shall recommend a balanced budget for 1971  but i can assure you that not only to present but to stay within a balanced budget requires some very hard decisions it means rejecting spending programs which would benefit some of the people when their net effect would result in price increases for all the people  it is time to quit putting good money into bad programs otherwise we will end up with bad money and bad programs  i recognize the political popularity of spending programs and particularly in an election year but unless we stop the rise in prices the cost of living for millions of american families will become unbearable and governments ability to plan programs for progress for the future will become impossible  in referring to budget cuts there is one area where i have ordered an increase rather than a cutand that is the requests of those agencies with the responsibilities for law enforcement  we have heard a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixties in which the word war has perhaps too often been usedthe war on poverty the war on misery the war on disease the war on hunger but if there is one area where the word war is appropriate it is in the fight against crime we must declare and win the war against the criminal elements which increasingly threaten our cities our homes and our lives  we have a tragic example of this problem in the nations capital for whose safety the congress and the executive have the primary responsibility i doubt if many members of this congress who live more than a few blocks from here would dare leave their cars in the capitol garage and walk home alone tonight  last year this administration sent to the congress 13 separate pieces of legislation dealing with organized crime pornography street crime narcotics crime in the district of columbia  none of these bills has reached my desk for signature  i am confident that the congress will act now to adopt the legislation i placed before you last year we in the executive have done everything we can under existing law but new and stronger weapons are needed in that fight  while it is true that state and local law enforcement agencies are the cutting edge in the effort to eliminate street crime burglaries murder my proposals to you have embodied my belief that the federal government should play a greater role in working in partnership with these agencies  that is why 1971 federal spending for local law enforcement will double that budgeted for 1970  the primary responsibility for crimes that affect individuals is with local and state rather than with federal government but in the field of organized crime narcotics pornography the federal government has a special responsibility it should fulfill and we should make washington dc where we have the primary responsibility an example to the nation and the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness  i now turn to a subject which next to our desire for peace may well become the major concern of the american people in the decade of the seventies  in the next 10 years we shall increase our wealth by 50 percent the profound question is does this mean we will be 50 percent richer in a real sense 50 percent better off 50 percent happier  or does it mean that in the year 1980 the president standing in this place will look back on a decade in which 70 percent of our people lived in metropolitan areas choked by traffic suffocated by smog poisoned by water deafened by noise and terrorized by crime  these are not the great questions that concern world leaders at summit conferences but people do not live at the summit they live in the foothills of everyday experience and it is time for all of us to concern ourselves with the way real people live in real life  the great question of the seventies is shall we surrender to our surroundings or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air to our land and to our water  restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond factions it has become a common cause of all the people of this country it is a cause of particular concern to young americans because they more than we will reap the grim consequences of our failure to act on programs which are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later  clean air clean water open spacesthese should once again be the birthright of every american if we act now they can be  we still think of air as free but clean air is not free and neither is clean water the price tag on pollution control is high through our years of past carelessness we incurred a debt to nature and now that debt is being called  the program i shall propose to congress will be the most comprehensive and costly program in this field in americas history  it is not a program for just one year a years plan in this field is no plan at all this is a time to look ahead not a year but 5 years or 10 yearswhatever time is required to do the job  i shall propose to this congress a 10 billion nationwide clean waters program to put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place in america where they are needed to make our waters clean again and do it now we have the industrial capacity if we begin now to build them all within 5 years this program will get them built within 5 years  as our cities and suburbs relentlessly expand those priceless open spaces needed for recreation areas accessible to their people are swallowed upoften forever unless we preserve these spaces while they are still available we will have none to preserve therefore i shall propose new financing methods for purchasing open space and parklands now before they are lost to us  the automobile is our worst polluter of the air adequate control requires further advances in engine design and fuel composition we shall intensify our research set increasingly strict standards and strengthen enforcement proceduresand we shall do it now  we can no longer afford to consider air and water common property free to be abused by anyone without regard to the consequences instead we should begin now to treat them as scarce resources which we are no more free to contaminate than we are free to throw garbage into our neighbors yard  this requires comprehensive new regulations it also requires that to the extent possible the price of goods should be made to include the costs of producing and disposing of them without damage to the environment  now i realize that the argument is often made that there is a fundamental contradiction between economic growth and the quality of life so that to have one we must forsake the other  the answer is not to abandon growth but to redirect it for example we should turn toward ending congestion and eliminating smog the same reservoir of inventive genius that created them in the first place  continued vigorous economic growth provides us with the means to enrich life itself and to enhance our planet as a place hospitable to man  each individual must enlist in this fight if it is to be won  it has been said that no matter how many national parks and historical monuments we buy and develop the truly significant environment for each of us is that in which we spend 80 percent of our timein our homes in our places of work the streets over which we travel  street litter rundown parking strips and yards dilapidated fences broken windows smoking automobiles dingy working places all should be the object of our fresh view  we have been too tolerant of our surroundings and too willing to leave it to others to clean up our environment it is time for those who make massive demands on society to make some minimal demands on themselves each of us must resolve that each day he will leave his home his property the public places of the city or town a little cleaner a little better a little more pleasant for himself and those around him  with the help of people we can do anything and without their help we can do nothing in this spirit together we can reclaim our land for ours and generations to come  between now and the year 2000 over 100 million children will be born in the united states where they grow upand howwill more than any one thing measure the quality of american life in these years ahead  this should be a warning to us  for the past 30 years our population has also been growing and shifting the result is exemplified in the vast areas of rural america emptying out of people and of promisea third of our counties lost population in the sixties  the violent and decayed central cities of our great metropolitan complexes are the most conspicuous area of failure in american life today  i propose that before these problems become insoluble the nation develop a national growth policy  in the future government decisions as to where to build highways locate airports acquire land or sell land should be made with a clear objective of aiding a balanced growth for america  in particular the federal government must be in a position to assist in the building of new cities and the rebuilding of old ones  at the same time we will carry our concern with the quality of life in america to the farm as well as the suburb to the village as well as to the city what rural america needs most is a new kind of assistance it needs to be dealt with not as a separate nation but as part of an overall growth policy for america we must create a new rural environment which will not only stem the migration to urban centers but reverse it if we seize our growth as a challenge we can make the 1970s an historic period when by conscious choice we transformed our land into what we want it to become  america which has pioneered in the new abundance and in the new technology is called upon today to pioneer in meeting the concerns which have followed in their wakein turning the wonders of science to the service of man  in the majesty of this great chamber we hear the echoes of americas history of debates that rocked the union and those that repaired it of the summons to war and the search for peace of the uniting of the people the building of a nation  those echoes of history remind us of our roots and our strengths  they remind us also of that special genius of american democracy which at one critical turning point after another has led us to spot the new road to the future and given us the wisdom and the courage to take it  as i look down that new road which i have tried to map out today i see a new america as we celebrate our 200th anniversary 6 years from now  i see an america in which we have abolished hunger provided the means for every family in the nation to obtain a minimum income made enormous progress in providing better housing faster transportation improved health and superior education  i see an america in which we have checked inflation and waged a winning war against crime  i see an america in which we have made great strides in stopping the pollution of our air cleaning up our water opening up our parks continuing to explore in space  most important i see an america at peace with all the nations of the world  this is not an impossible dream these goals are all within our reach  in times past our forefathers had the vision but not the means to achieve such goals  let it not be recorded that we were the first american generation that had the means but not the vision to make this dream come true  but let us above all recognize a fundamental truth we can be the best clothed best fed best housed people in the world enjoying clean air clean water beautiful parks but we could still be the unhappiest people in the world without an indefinable spiritthe lift of a driving dream which has made america from its beginning the hope of the world  two hundred years ago this was a new nation of 3 million people weak militarily poor economically but america meant something to the world then which could not be measured in dollars something far more important than military might  listen to president thomas jefferson in 1802 we act not for ourselves alone but for the whole human race  we had a spiritual quality then which caught the imagination of millions of people in the world  today when we are the richest and strongest nation in the world let it not be recorded that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which made us the hope of the world at the time of our birth  the demands of us in 1976 are even greater than in 1776  it is no longer enough to live and let live now we must live and help live  we need a fresh climate in america one in which a person can breathe freely and breathe in freedom  our recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness are not the same thing requires us to measure success or failure by new criteria  even more than the programs i have described today what this nation needs is an example from its elected leaders in providing the spiritual and moral leadership which no programs for material progress can satisfy  above all let us inspire young americans with a sense of excitement a sense of destiny a sense of involvement in meeting the challenges we face in this great period of our history only then are they going to have any sense of satisfaction in their lives  the greatest privilege an individual can have is to serve in a cause bigger than himself we have such a cause  how we seize the opportunities i have described today will determine not only our future but the future of peace and freedom in this world in the last third of the century  may god give us the wisdom the strength and above all the idealism to be worthy of that challenge so that america can fulfill its destiny of being the worlds best hope for liberty for opportunity for progress and peace for all peoples  
179, State of the Union Address, Richard Nixon,1971-01-22,  mr speaker mr president my colleagues in the congress our distinguished guests my fellow americans  as this 92d congress begins its session america has lost a great senator and all of us who had the privilege to know him have lost a loyal friend i had the privilege of visiting senator russell in the hospital just a few days before he died he never spoke about himself he only spoke eloquently about the need for a strong national defense in tribute to one of the most magnificent americans of all time i respectfully ask that all those here will rise in silent prayer for senator russell  thank you  mr speaker before i begin my formal address i want to use this opportunity to congratulate all of those who were winners in the rather spirited contest for leadership positions in the house and the senate and also to express my condolences to the losers i know how both of you feel  and i particularly want to join with all of the members of the house and the senate as well in congratulating the new speaker of the united states congress  to those new members of this house who may have some doubts about the possibilities for advancement in the years ahead i would remind you that the speaker and i met just 24 years ago in this chamber as freshmen members of the 80th congress as you see we both have come up in the world a bit since then  mr speaker this 92d congress has a chance to be recorded as the greatest congress in americas history  in these troubled years just past america has been going through a long nightmare of war and division of crime and inflation even more deeply we have gone through a long dark night of the american spirit but now that night is ending now we must let our spirits soar again now we are ready for the lift of a driving dream  the people of this nation are eager to get on with the quest for new greatness they see challenges and they are prepared to meet those challenges it is for us here to open the doors that will set free again the real greatness of this nationthe genius of the american people  how shall we meet this challenge how can we truly open the doors and set free the full genius of our people  the way in which the 92d congress answers these questions will determine its place in history more importantly it can determine this nations place in history as we enter the third century of our independence  tonight i shall present to the congress six great goals i shall ask not simply for more new programs in the old framework i shall ask to change the framework of government itselfto reform the entire structure of american government so we can make it again fully responsive to the needs and the wishes of the american people  if we act boldlyif we seize this moment and achieve these goalswe can close the gap between promise and performance in american government we can bring together the resources of this nation and the spirit of the american people  in discussing these great goals i shall deal tonight only with matters on the domestic side of the nations agenda i shall make a separate report to the congress and the nation next month on developments in foreign policy  the first of these great goals is already before the congress  i urge that the unfinished business of the 91st congress be made the first priority business of the 92d congress  over the next 2 weeks i will call upon congress to take action on more than 35 pieces of proposed legislation on which action was not completed last year  the most important is welfare reform  the present welfare system has become a monstrous consuming outragean outrage against the community against the taxpayer and particularly against the children it is supposed to help  we may honestly disagree as we do on what to do about it but we can all agree that we must meet the challenge not by pouring more money into a bad program but by abolishing the present welfare system and adopting a new one  so let us place a floor under the income of every family with children in americaand without those demeaning soulstifling affronts to human dignity that so blight the lives of welfare children today but let us also establish an effective work incentive and an effective work requirement  let us provide the means by which more can help themselves this shall be our goal  let us generously help those who are not able to help themselves but let us stop helping those who are able to help themselves but refuse to do so  the second great goal is to achieve what americans have not enjoyed since 1957full prosperity in peacetime  the tide of inflation has turned the rise in the cost of living which had been gathering dangerous momentum in the late sixties was reduced last year inflation will be further reduced this year  but as we have moved from runaway inflation toward reasonable price stability and at the same time as we have been moving from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy we have paid a price in increased unemployment  we should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment in this transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy is lower than in any peacetime year of the sixties  this is not good enough for the man who is unemployed in the seventies we must do better for workers in peacetime and we will do better  to achieve this i will submit an expansionary budget this yearone that will help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job opportunities for millions of americans  it will be a full employment budget a budget designed to be in balance if the economy were operating at its peak potential by spending as if we were at full employment we will help to bring about full employment  i ask the congress to accept these expansionary policiesto accept the concept of a full employment budget at the same time i ask the congress to cooperate in resisting expenditures that go beyond the limits of the full employment budget for as we wage a campaign to bring about a widely shared prosperity we must not reignite the fires of inflation and so undermine that prosperity  with the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget with the commitment of the independent federal reserve system to provide fully for the monetary needs of a growing economy and with a much greater effort on the part of labor and management to make their wage and price decisions in the light of the national interest and their own selfinterestthen for the worker the farmer the consumer for americans everywhere we shall gain the goal of a new prosperity more jobs more income more profits without inflation and without war  this is a great goal and one that we can achieve together  the third great goal is to continue the effort so dramatically begun last year to restore and enhance our natural environment  building on the foundation laid in the 37point program that i submitted to congress last year i will propose a strong new set of initiatives to clean up our air and water to combat noise and to preserve and restore our surroundings  i will propose programs to make better use of our land to encourage a balanced national growthgrowth that will revitalize our rural heartland and enhance the quality of life in america  and not only to meet todays needs but to anticipate those of tomorrow i will put forward the most extensive program ever proposed by a president of the united states to expand the nations parks recreation areas open spaces in a way that truly brings parks to the people where the people are for only if we leave a legacy of parks will the next generation have parks to enjoy  as a fourth great goal i will offer a farreaching set of proposals for improving americas health care and making it available more fairly to more people  i will propose  a program to insure that no american family will be prevented from obtaining basic medical care by inability to pay  i will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical schools to greatly increase the number of doctors and other health personnel  incentives to improve the delivery of health services to get more medical care resources into those areas that have not been adequately served to make greater use of medical assistants and to slow the alarming rise in the costs of medical care  new programs to encourage better preventive medicine by attacking the causes of disease and injury and by providing incentives to doctors to keep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick  i will also ask for an appropriation of an extra 100 million to launch an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer and i will ask later for whatever additional funds can effectively be used the time has come in america when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease let us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal  america has long been the wealthiest nation in the world now it is time we became the healthiest nation in the world  the fifth great goal is to strengthen and to renew our state and local governments  as we approach our 200th anniversary in 1976 we remember that this nation launched itself as a loose confederation of separate states without a workable central government at that time the mark of its leaders vision was that they quickly saw the need to balance the separate powers of the states with a government of central powers  and so they gave us a constitution of balanced powers of unity with diversityand so clear was their vision that it survives today as the oldest written constitution still in force in the world  for almost two centuries sinceand dramatically in the 1930sat those great turning points when the question has been between the states and the federal government that question has been resolved in favor of a stronger central federal government  during this time the nation grew and the nation prospered but one thing history tells us is that no great movement goes in the same direction forever nations change they adapt or they slowly die  the time has now come in america to reverse the flow of power and resources from the states and communities to washington and start power and resources flowing back from washington to the states and communities and more important to the people all across america  the time has come for a new partnership between the federal government and the states and localitiesa partnership in which we entrust the states and localities with a larger share of the nations responsibilities and in which we share our federal revenues with them so that they can meet those responsibilities  to achieve this goal i propose to the congress tonight that we enact a plan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept  all across america today states and cities are confronted with a financial crisis some have already been cutting back on essential servicesfor example just recently san diego and cleveland cut back on trash collections most are caught between the prospects of bankruptcy on the one hand and adding to an already crushing tax burden on the other  as one indication of the rising costs of local government i discovered the other day that my home town of whittier californiawhich has a population of 67000has a larger budget for 1971 than the entire federal budget was in 1791  now the time has come to take a new direction and once again to introduce a new and more creative balance to our approach to government  so let us put the money where the needs are and let us put the power to spend it where the people are  i propose that the congress make a 16 billion investment in renewing state and local government five billion dollars of this will be in new and unrestricted funds to be used as the states and localities see fit the other 11 billion will be provided by allocating 1 billion of new funds and converting onethird of the money going to the present narrowpurpose aid programs into federal revenue sharing funds for six broad purposesfor urban development rural development education transportation job training and law enforcementbut with the states and localities making their own decisions on how it should be spent within each category  for the next fiscal year this would increase total federal aid to the states and localities more than 25 percent over the present level  the revenue sharing proposals i send to the congress will include the safeguards against discrimination that accompany all other federal funds allocated to the states neither the president nor the congress nor the conscience of this nation can permit money which comes from all the people to be used in a way which discriminates against some of the people  the federal government will still have a large and vital role to play in achieving our national progress established functions that are clearly and essentially federal in nature will still be performed by the federal government new functions that need to be sponsored or performed by the federal governmentsuch as those i have urged tonight in welfare and healthwill be added to the federal agenda whenever it makes the best sense for us to act as a whole nation the federal government should and will lead the way but where states or local governments can better do what needs to be done let us see that they have the resources to do it there  under this plan the federal government will provide the states and localities with more money and less interferenceand by cutting down the interference the same amount of money will go a lot further  let us share our resources  let us share them to rescue the states and localities from the brink of financial crisis  let us share them to give homeowners and wage earners a chance to escape from everhigher property taxes and sales taxes  let us share our resources for two other reasons as well  the first of these reasons has to do with government itself and the second has to do with each of us with the individual  lets face it most americans today are simply fed up with government at all levels they will notand they should notcontinue to tolerate the gap between promise and performance in government  the fact is that we have made the federal government so strong it grows musclebound and the states and localities so weak they approach impotence  if we put more power in more places we can make government more creative in more places that way we multiply the number of people with the ability to make things happenand we can open the way to a new burst of creative energy throughout america  the final reason i urge this historic shift is much more personal for each and for every one of us  as everything seems to have grown bigger and more complex in america as the forces that shape our lives seem to have grown more distant and more impersonal a great feeling of frustration has crept across this land  whether it is the workingman who feels neglected the black man who feels oppressed or the mother concerned about her children there has been a growing feeling that things are in the saddle and ride mankind  millions of frustrated young americans today are crying outasking not what will government do for me but what can i do how can i contribute how can i matter  and so let us answer them let us say to them and let us say to all americans we hear you we will give you a chance we are going to give you a new chance to have more to say about the decisions that affect your futurea chance to participate in governmentbecause we are going to provide more centers of power where what you do can make a difference that you can see and feel in your own life and the life of your whole community  the further away government is from people the stronger government becomes and the weaker people become and a nation with a strong government and a weak people is an empty shell  i reject the patronizing idea that government in washington dc is inevitably more wise more honest and more efficient than government at the local or state level the honesty and efficiency of government depends on people government at all levels has good people and bad people and the way to get more good people into government is to give them more opportunity to do good things  the idea that a bureaucratic elite in washington knows best what is best for people everywhere and that you cannot trust local governments is really a contention that you cannot trust people to govern themselves this notion is completely foreign to the american experience local government is the government closest to the people it is most responsive to the individual person it is peoples government in a far more intimate way than the government in washington can ever be  people came to america because they wanted to determine their own future rather than to live in a country where others determined their future for them  what this change means is that once again in america we are placing our trust in people  i have faith in people i trust the judgment of people let us give the people of america a chance a bigger voice in deciding for themselves those questions that so greatly affect their lives  the sixth great goal is a complete reform of the federal government itself  based on a long and intensive study with the aid of the best advice obtainable i have concluded that a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch is needed if the government is to keep up with the times and with the needs of the people  i propose therefore that we reduce the present 12 cabinet departments to eight  i propose that the departments of state treasury defense and justice remain but that all the other departments be consolidated into four human resources community development natural resources and economic development  let us look at what these would be  first a department dealing with the concerns of peopleas individuals as members of a familya department focused on human needs  second a department concerned with the communityrural communities and urban communitiesand with all that it takes to make a community function as a community  third a department concerned with our physical environment with the preservation and balanced use of those great natural resources on which our nation depends  and fourth a department concerned with our prosperitywith our jobs our businesses and those many activities that keep our economy running smoothly and well  under this plan rather than dividing up our departments by narrow subjects we would organize them around the great purposes of government rather than scattering responsibility by adding new levels of bureaucracy we would focus and concentrate the responsibility for getting problems solved  with these four departments when we have a problem we will know where to goand the department will have the authority and the resources to do something about it  over the years we have added departments and created agencies at the federal level each to serve a new constituency to handle a particular taskand these have grown and multiplied in what has become a hopeless confusion of form and function  the time has come to match our structure to our purposesto look with a fresh eye to organize the government by conscious comprehensive design to meet the new needs of a new era  one hundred years ago abraham lincoln stood on a battlefield and spoke of a government of the people by the people for the people too often since then we have become a nation of the government by the government for the government  by enacting these reforms we can renew that principle that lincoln stated so simply and so well  by giving everyones voice a chance to be heard we will have government that truly is of the people  by creating more centers of meaningful power more places where decisions that really count can be made by giving more people a chance to do something we can have government that truly is by the people  and by setting up a completely modern functional system of government at the national level we in washington will at last be able to provide government that is truly for the people  i realize that what i am asking is that not only the executive branch in washington but that even this congress will have to change by giving up some of its power  change is hard but without change there can be no progress and for each of us the question then becomes not will change cause me inconvenience but will change bring progress for america  giving up power is hard but i would urge all of you as leaders of this country to remember that the truly revered leaders in world history are those who gave power to people and not those who took it away  as we consider these reforms we will be acting not for the next 2 years or for the next 10 years but for the next 100 years  so let us approach these six great goals with a sense not only of this moment in history but also of history itself  let us act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the boldness and the courage of those great americans who met in philadelphia almost 190 years ago to write a constitution  let us leave a heritage as they didnot just for our children but for millions yet unbornof a nation where every american will have a chance not only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to participate in a system of government where he knows not only his votes but his ideas counta system of government which will provide the means for america to reach heights of achievement undreamed of before  those men who met at philadelphia left a great heritage because they had a visionnot only of what the nation was but of what it could become  as i think of that vision i recall that america was founded as the land of the open dooras a haven for the oppressed a land of opportunity a place of refuge of hope  when the first settlers opened the door of america three and a half centuries ago they came to escape persecution and to find opportunityand they left wide the door of welcome for others to follow  when the thirteen colonies declared their independence almost two centuries ago they opened the door to a new vision of liberty and of human fulfillmentnot just for an elite but for all  to the generations that followed americas was the open door that beckoned millions from the old world to the new in search of a better life a freer life a fuller life and in which by their own decisions they could shape their own destinies  for the black american the indian the mexicanamerican and for those others in our land who have not had an equal chance the nation at last has begun to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal opportunity and of human dignity  for all americans with these changes i have proposed tonight we can open the door to a new era of opportunity we can open the door to full and effective participation in the decisions that affect their lives we can open the door to a new partnership among governments at all levels between those governments and the people themselves and by so doing we can open wide the doors of human fulfillment for millions of people here in america now and in the years to come  in the next few weeks i will spell out in greater detail the way i propose that we achieve these six great goals i ask this congress to be responsive if it is then the 92d congress your congress our congress at the end of its term will be able to look back on a record more splendid than any in our history  this can be the congress that helped us end the longest war in the nations history and end it in a way that will give us at last a genuine chance to enjoy what we have not had in this century a full generation of peace  this can be the congress that helped achieve an expanding economy with full employment and without inflationand without the deadly stimulus of war  this can be the congress that reformed a welfare system that has robbed recipients of their dignity and robbed states and cities of their resources  this can be the congress that pressed forward the rescue of our environment and established for the next generation an enduring legacy of parks for the people  this can be the congress that launched a new era in american medicine in which the quality of medical care was enhanced while the costs were made less burdensome  but above all what this congress can be remembered for is opening the way to a new american revolutiona peaceful revolution in which power was turned back to the peoplein which government at all levels was refreshed and renewed and made truly responsive this can be a revolution as profound as farreaching as exciting as that first revolution almost 200 years agoand it can mean that just 5 years from now america will enter its third century as a young nation new in spirit with all the vigor and the freshness with which it began its first century  my colleagues in the congress these are great goals they can make the sessions of this congress a great moment for america so let us pledge together to go forward togetherby achieving these goals to give america the foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the years to come and in so doing to make this the greatest congress in the history of this great and good country  
180, State of the Union Address, Richard Nixon,1972-01-20,  mr speaker mr president my colleagues in the congress our distinguished guests my fellow americans  twentyfive years ago i sat here as a freshman congressmanalong with speaker albertand listened for the first time to the president address the state of the union  i shall never forget that moment the senate the diplomatic corps the supreme court the cabinet entered the chamber and then the president of the united states as all of you are aware i had some differences with president truman he had some with me but i remember that on that daythe day he addressed that joint session of the newly elected republican 80th congress he spoke not as a partisan but as president of all the peoplecalling upon the congress to put aside partisan considerations in the national interest  the greekturkish aid program the marshall plan the great foreign policy initiatives which have been responsible for avoiding a world war for over 25 years were approved by the 80th congress by a bipartisan majority of which i was proud to be a part  nineteen hundred seventytwo is now before us it holds precious time in which to accomplish good for the nation we must not waste it i know the political pressures in this session of the congress will be great there are more candidates for the presidency in this chamber today than there probably have been at any one time in the whole history of the republic and there is an honest difference of opinion not only between the parties but within each party on some foreign policy issues and on some domestic policy issues  however there are great national problems that are so vital that they transcend partisanship so let us have our debates let us have our honest differences but let us join in keeping the national interest first let us join in making sure that legislation the nation needs does not become hostage to the political interests of any party or any person  there is ample precedent in this election year for me to present you with a huge list of new proposals knowing full well that there would not be any possibility of your passing them if you worked night and day  i shall not do that  i have presented to the leaders of the congress today a message of 15000 words discussing in some detail where the nation stands and setting forth specific legislative items on which i have asked the congress to act much of this is legislation which i proposed in 1969 in 1970 and also in the first session of this 92d congress and on which i feel it is essential that action be completed this year  i am not presenting proposals which have attractive labels but no hope of passage i am presenting only vital programs which are within the capacity of this congress to enact within the capacity of the budget to finance and which i believe should be above partisanshipprograms which deal with urgent priorities for the nation which should and must be the subject of bipartisan action by this congress in the interests of the country in 1972  when i took the oath of office on the steps of this building just 3 years ago today the nation was ending one of the most tortured decades in its history  the 1960s were a time of great progress in many areas but as we all know they were also times of great agonythe agonies of war of inflation of rapidly rising crime of deteriorating titles of hopes raised and disappointed and of anger and frustration that led finally to violence and to the worst civil disorder in a century  i recall these troubles not to point any fingers of blame the nation was so torn in those final years of the sixties that many in both parties questioned whether america could be governed at all  the nation has made significant progress in these first years of the seventies  our cities are no longer engulfed by civil disorders  our colleges and universities have again become places of learning instead of battlegrounds  a beginning has been made in preserving and protecting our environment  the rate of increase in crime has been slowedand here in the district of columbia the one city where the federal government has direct jurisdiction serious crime in 1971 was actually reduced by 13 percent from the year before  most important because of the beginnings that have been made we can say today that this year 1972 can be the year in which america may make the greatest progress in 25 years toward achieving our goal of being at peace with all the nations of the world  as our involvement in the war in vietnam comes to an end we must now go on to build a generation of peace  to achieve that goal we must first face realistically the need to maintain our defense  in the past 3 years we have reduced the burden of arms for the first time in 20 years spending on defense has been brought below spending on human resources  as we look to the future we find encouraging progress in our negotiations with the soviet union on limitation of strategic arms and looking further into the future we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual reduction of arms but until there is such a mutual agreement we must maintain the strength necessary to deter war  and that is why because of rising research and development costs because of increases in military and civilian pay because of the need to proceed with new weapons systems my budget for the coming fiscal year will provide for an increase in defense spending  strong military defenses are not the enemy of peace they are the guardians of peace  there could be no more misguided set of priorities than one which would tempt others by weakening america and thereby endanger the peace of the world  in our foreign policy we have entered a new era the world has changed greatly in the 11 years since president john kennedy said in his inaugural address  we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty  our policy has been carefully and deliberately adjusted to meet the new realities of the new world we live in we make today only those commitments we are able and prepared to meet  our commitment to freedom remains strong and unshakable but others must bear their share of the burden of defending freedom around the world  and so this then is our policy  we will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the security of the united states or of our allies  we will help other nations develop the capability of defending themselves  we will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments  we will act to defend our interests whenever and wherever they are threatened anyplace in the world  but where our interests or our treaty commitments are not involved our role will be limited  we will not intervene militarily  but we will use our influence to prevent war  if war comes we will use our influence to stop it  once it is over we will do our share in helping to bind up the wounds of those who have participated in it  as you know i will soon be visiting the peoples republic of china and the soviet union i go there with no illusions we have great differences with both powers we shall continue to have great differences but peace depends on the ability of great powers to live together on the same planet despite their differences  we would not be true to our obligation to generations yet unborn if we failed to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that we will be able to talk about those differences rather than to fight about them in the future  as we look back over this century let us in the highest spirit of bipartisanship recognize that we can be proud of our nations record in foreign affairs  america has given more generously of itself toward maintaining freedom preserving peace alleviating human suffering around the globe than any nation has ever done in the history of man  we have fought four wars in this century but our power has never been used to break the peace only to keep it never been used to destroy freedom only to defend it we now have within our reach the goal of insuring that the next generation can be the first generation in this century to be spared the scourges of war  turning to our problems at home we are making progress toward our goal of a new prosperity without war  industrial production consumer spending retail sales personal income all have been rising total employment real income are the highest in history new home building starts this past year reached the highest level ever business and consumer confidence have both been rising interest rates are down the rate of inflation is down we can look with confidence to 1972 as the year when the back of inflation will be broken  now this a good record but it is not good enoughnot when we still have an unemployment rate of 6 percent  it is not enough to point out that this was the rate of the early peacetime years of the sixties or that if the more than 2 million men released from the armed forces and defenserelated industries were still in their wartime jobs unemployment would be far lower  our goal in this country is full employment in peacetime we intend to meet that goal and we can  the congress has helped to meet that goal by passing our jobcreating tax program last month  the historic monetary agreements agreements that we have reached with the major european nations canada and japan will help meet it by providing new markets for american products new jobs for american workers  our budget will help meet it by being expansionary without being inflationarya jobproducing budget that will help take up the gap as the economy expands to full employment  our program to raise farm income will help meet it by helping to revitalize rural america by giving to americas farmers their fair share of americas increasing productivity  we also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a set of major initiatives to stimulate more imaginative use of americas great capacity for technological advance and to direct it toward improving the quality of life for every american  in reaching the moon we demonstrated what miracles american technology is capable of achieving now the time has come to move more deliberately toward making full use of that technology here on earth of harnessing the wonders of science to the service of man  i shall soon send to the congress a special message proposing a new program of federal partnership in technological research and developmentwith federal incentives to increase private research federally supported research on projects designed to improve our everyday lives in ways that will range from improving mass transit to developing new systems of emergency health care that could save thousands of lives annually  historically our superior technology and high productivity have made it possible for american workers to be the highest paid in the world by far and yet for our goods still to compete in world markets  now we face a new situation as other nations move rapidly forward in technology the answer to the new competition is not to build a wall around america but rather to remain competitive by improving our own technology still further and by increasing productivity in american industry  our new monetary and trade agreements will make it possible for american goods to compete fairly in the worlds marketsbut they still must compete the new technology program will put to use the skills of many highly trained americans skills that might otherwise be wasted it will also meet the growing technological challenge from abroad and it will thus help to create new industries as well as creating more jobs for americas workers in producing for the worlds markets  this second session of the 92d congress already has before it more than 90 major administration proposals which still await action  i have discussed these in the extensive written message that i have presented to the congress today  they include among others our programs to improve life for the aging to combat crime and drug abuse to improve health services and to ensure that no one will be denied needed health care because of inability to pay to protect workers pension rights to promote equal opportunity for members of minorities and others who have been left behind to expand consumer protection to improve the environment to revitalize rural america to help the cities to launch new initiatives in education to improve transportation and to put an end to costly labor tieups in transportation  the west coast dock strike is a case in point this nation cannot and will not tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tieup in the future  the messages also include basic reforms which are essential if our structure of government is to be adequate in the decades ahead  they include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare systemsubstitution of a new system that provides work requirements and work incentives for those who can help themselves income support for those who cannot help themselves and fairness to the working poor  they include a 17 billion program of federal revenue sharing with the states and localities as an investment in their renewal an investment also of faith in the american people  they also include a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch of the federal government so that it will be more efficient more responsive and able to meet the challenges of the decades ahead  one year ago standing in this place i laid before the opening session of this congress six great goals one of these was welfare reform that proposal has been before the congress now for nearly 2 12 years  my proposals on revenue sharing government reorganization health care and the environment have now been before the congress for nearly a year many of the other major proposals that i have referred to have been here that long or longer  now 1971 we can say was a year of consideration of these measures now let us join in making 1972 a year of action on them action by the congress for the nation and for the people of america  now in addition there is one pressing need which i have not previously covered but which must be placed on the national agenda  we long have looked in this nation to the local property tax as the main source of financing for public primary and secondary education  as a result soaring school costs soaring property tax rates now threaten both our communities and our schools they threaten communities because property taxes which more than doubled in the 10 years from 1960 to 70 have become one of the most oppressive and discriminatory of all taxes hitting most cruelly at the elderly and the retired and they threaten schools as hardpressed voters understandably reject new bond issues at the polls  the problem has been given even greater urgency by four recent court decisions which have held that the conventional method of financing schools through local property taxes is discriminatory and unconstitutional  nearly 2 years ago i named a special presidential commission to study the problems of school finance and i also directed the federal departments to look into the same problems we are developing comprehensive proposals to meet these problems  this issue involves two complex and interrelated sets of problems support of the schools and the basic relationships of federal state and local governments in any tax reforms  under the leadership of the secretary of the treasury we are carefully reviewing all of the tax aspects and i have this week enlisted the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations in addressing the intergovernmental relations aspects  i have asked this bipartisan commission to review our proposals for federal action to cope with the gathering crisis of school finance and property taxes later in the year when both commissions have completed their studies i shall make my final recommendations for relieving the burden of property taxes and providing both fair and adequate financing for our childrens education  these recommendations will be revolutionary but all these recommendations however will be rooted in one fundamental principle with which there can be no compromise local school boards must have control over local schools  as we look ahead over the coming decades vast new growth and change are not only certainties they will be the dominant reality of this world and particularly of our life in america  surveying the certainty of rapid change we can be like a fallen rider caught in the stirrupsor we can sit high in the saddle the masters of change directing it on a course we choose  the secret of mastering change in todays world is to reach back to old and proven principles and to adapt them with imagination and intelligence to the new realities of a new age  that is what we have done in the proposals that i have laid before the congress they are rooted in basic principles that are as enduring as human nature as robust as the american experience and they are responsive to new conditions thus they represent a spirit of change that is truly renewal  as we look back at those old principles we find them as timely as they are timeless  we believe in independence and selfreliance and the creative value of the competitive spirit  we believe in full and equal opportunity for all americans and in the protection of individual rights and liberties  we believe in the family as the keystone of the community and in the community as the keystone of the nation  we believe in compassion toward those in need  we believe in a system of law justice and order as the basis of a genuinely free society  we believe that a person should get what he works forand that those who can should work for what they get  we believe in the capacity of people to make their own decisions in their own lives in their own communitiesand we believe in their right to make those decisions  in applying these principles we have done so with the full understanding that what we seek in the seventies what our quest is is not merely for more but for better for a better quality of life for all americans  thus for example we are giving a new measure of attention to cleaning up our air and water making our surroundings more attractive we are providing broader support for the arts helping stimulate a deeper appreciation of what they can contribute to the nations activities and to our individual lives  but nothing really matters more to the quality of our lives than the way we treat one another than our capacity to live respectfully together as a unified society with a full generous regard for the rights of others and also for the feelings of others  as we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent years as we learn once again to speak with one another instead of shouting at one another we are regaining that capacity  as is customary here on this occasion i have been talking about programs programs are important but even more important than programs is what we are as a nationwhat we mean as a nation to ourselves and to the world  in new york harbor stands one of the most famous statues in the worldthe statue of liberty the gift in 1886 of the people of france to the people of the united states this statue is more than a landmark it is a symbola symbol of what america has meant to the world  it reminds us that what america has meant is not its wealth and not its power but its spirit and purposea land that enshrines liberty and opportunity and that has held out a hand of welcome to millions in search of a better and a fuller and above all a freer life  the worlds hopes poured into america along with its people and those hopes those dreams that have been brought here from every corner of the world have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world  four years from now america will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its founding as a nation there are those who say that the old spirit of 76 is deadthat we no longer have the strength of character the idealism the faith in our founding purposes that that spirit represents  those who say this do not know america  we have been undergoing selfdoubts and selfcriticism but these are only the other side of our growing sensitivity to the persistence of want in the midst of plenty of our impatience with the slowness with which ageold ills are being overcome  if we were indifferent to the shortcomings of our society or complacent about our institutions or blind to the lingering inequitiesthen we would have lost our way  but the fact that we have those concerns is evidence that our ideals deep down are still strong indeed they remind us that what is really best about america is its compassion they remind us that in the final analysis america is great not because it is strong not because it is rich but because this is a good country  let us reject the narrow visions of those who would tell us that we are evil because we are not yet perfect that we are corrupt because we are not yet pure that all the sweat and toil and sacrifice that have gone into the building of america were for naught because the building is not yet done  let us see that the path we are traveling is wide with room in it for all of us and that its direction is toward a better nation and a more peaceful world  never has it mattered more that we go forward together  look at this chamber the leadership of america is here todaythe supreme court the cabinet the senate the house of representatives  together we hold the future of the nation and the conscience of the nation in our hands  because this year is an election year it will be a time of great pressure  if we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the historic challenges that we face we will have failed the trust of millions of americans and shaken the confidence they have a right to place in us in their government  never has a congress had a greater opportunity to leave a legacy of a profound and constructive reform for the nation than this congress  if we succeed in these tasks there will be credit enough for allnot only for doing what is right but doing it in the right way by rising above partisan interest to serve the national interest  and if we fail more than any one of us america will be the loser  that is why my call upon the congress today is for a high statesmanship so that in the years to come americans will look back and say because it withstood the intense pressures of a political year and achieved such great good for the american people and for the future of this nation this was truly a great congress  
181, State of the Union Address, Richard Nixon,1973-02-02,  to the congress of the united states  the traditional form of the presidents annual report giving to the congress information of the state of the union is a single message or address as the affairs and concerns of our union have multiplied over the years however so too have the subjects that require discussion in state of the union messages  this year in particular with so many changes in government programs under considerationand with our very philosophy about the relationship between the individual and the state at an historic crossroadsa single allembracing state of the union message would not appear to be adequate  i have therefore decided to present my 1973 state of the union report in the form of a series of messages during these early weeks of the 93rd congress the purpose of this first message in the series is to give a concise overview of where we stand as a people today and to outline some of the general goals that i believe we should pursue over the next year and beyond in coming weeks i will send to the congress further state of the union reports on specific areas of policy including economic affairs natural resources human resources community development and foreign and defense policy  the new course these messages will outline represents a fresh approach to government an approach that addresses the realities of the 1970s not those of the 1930s or of the 1960s the role of the federal government as we approach our third century of independence should not be to dominate any facet of american life but rather to aid and encourage people communities and institutions to deal with as many of the difficulties and challenges facing them as possible and to help see to it that every american has a full and equal opportunity to realize his or her potential  if we were to continue to expand the federal government at the rate of the past several decades it soon would consume us entirely the time has come when we must make clear choiceschoices between old programs that set worthy goals but failed to reach them and new programs that provide a better way to realize those goals and choices too between competing programsall of which may be desirable in themselves but only some of which we can afford with the finite resources at our command  because our resources are not infinite we also face a critical choice in 1973 between holding the line in government spending and adopting expensive programs which will surely force up taxes and refuel inflation  finally it is vital at this time that we restore a greater sense of responsibility at the state and local level and among individual americans  where we stand  the basic state of our union today is sound and full of promise  we enter 1973 economically strong militarily secure and most important of all at peace after a long and trying war  america continues to provide a better and more abundant life for more of its people than any other nation in the world we have passed through one of the most difficult periods in our history without surrendering to despair and without dishonoring our ideals as a people  looking back there is a lesson in all this for all of us the lesson is one that we sometimes had to learn the hard way over the past few years but we did learn it that lesson is that even potentially destructive forces can be converted into positive forces when we know how to channel them and when we use common sense and common decency to create a climate of mutual respect and goodwill  by working together and harnessing the forces of nature americans have unlocked some of the great mysteries of the universe  men have walked the surface of the moon and soared to new heights of discovery  this same spirit of discovery is helping us to conquer disease and suffering that have plagued our own planet since the dawn of time  by working together with the leaders of other nations we have been able to build a new hope for lasting peacefor a structure of world order in which common interest outweighs old animosities and in which a new generation of the human family can grow up at peace in a changing world  at home we have learned that by working together we can create prosperity without fanning inflation we can restore order without weakening freedom  the challenges we face  these first years of the 1970s have been good years for america  our joball of us togetheris to make 1973 and the years to come even better ones i believe that we can i believe that we can make the years leading to our bicentennial the best four years in american history  but we must never forget that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without the will to succeed and the strength to sacrifice  hard decisions must be made and we must stick by them  in the field of foreign policy we must remember that a strong americaan america whose word is believed and whose strength is respectedis essential to continued peace and understanding in the world the peace with honor we have achieved in vietnam has strengthened this basic american credibility we must act in such a way in coming years that this credibility will remain intact and with it the world stability of which it is so indispensable a part  at home we must reject the mistaken notiona notion that has dominated too much of the public dialogue for too longthat ever bigger government is the answer to every problem  we have learned only too well that heavy taxation and excessive government spending are not a cureall in too many cases instead of solving the problems they were aimed at they have merely placed an ever heavier burden on the shoulders of the american taxpayer in the form of higher taxes and a higher cost of living at the same time they have deceived our people because many of the intended beneficiaries received far less than was promised thus undermining public faith in the effectiveness of government as a whole  the time has come for us to draw the line the time has come for the responsible leaders of both political parties to take a stand against overgrown government and for the american taxpayer we are not spending the federal governments money we are spending the taxpayers money and it must be spent in a way which guarantees his moneys worth and yields the fullest possible benefit to the people being helped  the answer to many of the domestic problems we face is not higher taxes and more spending it is less waste more results and greater freedom for the individual american to earn a rightful place in his own communityand for states and localities to address their own needs in their own ways in the light of their own priorities  by giving the people and their locally elected leaders a greater voice through changes such as revenue sharing and by saying no to excessive federal spending and higher taxes we can help achieve this goal  coming messages  the policies which i will outline to the congress in the weeks ahead represent a reaffirmation not an abdication of federal responsibility they represent a pragmatic rededication to social compassion and national excellence in place of the combination of good intentions and fuzzy followthrough which too often in the past was thought sufficient  in the field of economic affairs our objectives will be to hold down taxes to continue controlling inflation to promote economic growth to increase productivity to encourage foreign trade to keep farm income high to bolster small business and to promote better labormanagement relations  in the area of natural resources my recommendations will include programs to preserve and enhance the environment to advance science and technology and to assure balanced use of our irreplaceable natural resources  in developing human resources i will have recommendations to advance the nations health and education to improve conditions of people in need to carry forward our increasingly successful attacks on crime drug abuse and injustice and to deal with such important areas of special concern as consumer affairs we will continue and improve our nations efforts to assist those who have served in the armed services in vietnam through better job and training opportunities  we must do a better job in community developmentin creating more livable communities in which all of our children can grow up with fuller access to opportunity and greater immunity to the social evils and blights which now plague so many of our towns and cities i shall have proposals to help us achieve this  i shall also deal with our defense and foreign policies and with our new approaches to the role and structure of government itself  considered as a whole this series of messages will be a blueprint for modernizing the concept and the functions of american government to meet the needs of our people  converting it into reality will require a spirit of cooperation and shared commitment on the part of all branches of the government for the goals we seek are not those of any single party or faction they are goals for the betterment of all americans as president i recognize that i cannot do this job alone the congress must help and i pledge to do my part to achieve a constructive working relationship with the congress my sincere hope is that the executive and legislative branches can work together in this great undertaking in a positive spirit of mutual respect and cooperation  working togetherthe congress the president and the peoplei am confident that we can translate these proposals into an action program that can reform and revitalize american government and even more important build a better life for all americans  the white house  february 2 1973  
182, State of the Union Address, Richard Nixon,1974-01-30,  mr speaker mr president my colleagues in the congress our distinguished guests my fellow americans  we meet here tonight at a time of great challenge and great opportunities for america we meet at a time when we face great problems at home and abroad that will test the strength of our fiber as a nation but we also meet at a time when that fiber has been tested and it has proved strong  america is a great and good land and we are a great and good land because we are a strong free creative people and because america is the single greatest force for peace anywhere in the world today as always in our history we can base our confidence in what the american people will achieve in the future on the record of what the american people have achieved in the past  tonight for the first time in 12 years a president of the united states can report to the congress on the state of a union at peace with every nation of the world because of this in the 22000word message on the state of the union that i have just handed to the speaker of the house and the president of the senate i have been able to deal primarily with the problems of peace with what we can do here at home in america for the american peoplerather than with the problems of war  the measures i have outlined in this message set an agenda for truly significant progress for this nation and the world in 1974 before we chart where we are going let us see how far we have come  it was 5 years ago on the steps of this capitol that i took the oath of office as your president in those 5 years because of the initiatives undertaken by this administration the world has changed america has changed as a result of those changes america is safer today more prosperous today with greater opportunity for more of its people than ever before in our history  five years ago america was at war in southeast asia we were locked in confrontation with the soviet union we were in hostile isolation from a quarter of the worlds people who lived in mainland china  five years ago our cities were burning and besieged  five years ago our college campuses were a battleground  five years ago crime was increasing at a rate that struck fear across the nation  five years ago the spiraling rise in drug addiction was threatening human and social tragedy of massive proportion and there was no program to deal with it  five years agoas young americans had done for a generation before thatamericas youth still lived under the shadow of the military draft  five years ago there was no national program to preserve our environment day by day our air was getting dirtier our water was getting more foul  and 5 years ago american agriculture was practically a depressed industry with 100000 farm families abandoning the farm every year  as we look at america today we find ourselves challenged by new problems but we also find a record of progress to confound the professional criers of doom and prophets of despair we met the challenges we faced 5 years ago and we will be equally confident of meeting those that we face today  let us see for a moment how we have met them  after more than 10 years of military involvement all of our troops have returned from southeast asia and they have returned with honor and we can be proud of the fact that our courageous prisoners of war for whom a dinner was held in washington tonight that they came home with their heads high on their feet and not on their knees  in our relations with the soviet union we have turned away from a policy of confrontation to one of negotiation for the first time since world war ii the worlds two strongest powers are working together toward peace in the world with the peoples republic of china after a generation of hostile isolation we have begun a period of peaceful exchange and expanding trade  peace has returned to our cities to our campuses the 17year rise in crime has been stopped we can confidently say today that we are finally beginning to win the war against crime right here in this nations capitalwhich a few years ago was threatening to become the crime capital of the worldthe rate in crime has been cut in half a massive campaign against drug abuse has been organized and the rate of new heroin addiction the most vicious threat of all is decreasing rather than increasing  for the first time in a generation no young americans are being drafted into the armed services of the united states and for the first time ever we have organized a massive national effort to protect the environment our air is getting cleaner our water is getting purer and our agriculture which was depressed is prospering farm income is up 70 percent farm production is setting alltime records and the billions of dollars the taxpayers were paying in subsidies has been cut to nearly zero  overall americans are living more abundantly than ever before today more than 2 12 million new jobs were created in the past year alone that is the biggest percentage increase in nearly 20 years people are earning more what they earn buys more more than ever before in history in the past 5 years the average americans real spendable incomethat is what you really can buy with your income even after allowing for taxes and inflationhas increased by 16 percent  despite this record of achievement as we turn to the year ahead we hear once again the familiar voice of the perennial prophets of gloom telling us now that because of the need to fight inflation because of the energy shortage america may be headed for a recession  let me speak to that issue head on there will be no recession in the united states of america primarily due to our energy crisis our economy is passing through a difficult period but i pledge to you tonight that the full powers of this government will be used to keep americas economy producing and to protect the jobs of americas workers  we are engaged in a long and hard fight against inflation there have been and there will be in the future ups and downs in that fight but if this congress cooperates in our efforts to hold down the cost of government we shall win our fight to hold down the cost of living for the american people  as we look back over our history the years that stand out as the ones of signal achievement are those in which the administration and the congress whether one party or the other working together had the wisdom and the foresight to select those particular initiatives for which the nation was ready and the moment was rightand in which they seized the moment and acted  looking at the year 1974 which lies before us there are 10 key areas in which landmark accomplishments are possible this year in america if we make these our national agenda this is what we will achieve in 1974  we will break the back of the energy crisis we will lay the foundation for our future capacity to meet americas energy needs from americas own resources  and we will take another giant stride toward lasting peace in the worldnot only by continuing our policy of negotiation rather than confrontation where the great powers are concerned but also by helping toward the achievement of a just and lasting settlement in the middle east  we will check the rise in prices without administering the harsh medicine of recession and we will move the economy into a steady period of growth at a sustainable level  we will establish a new system that makes highquality health care available to every american in a dignified manner and at a price he can afford  we will make our states and localities more responsive to the needs of their own citizens  we will make a crucial breakthrough toward better transportation in our towns and in our cities across america  we will reform our system of federal aid to education to provide it when it is needed where it is needed so that it will do the most for those who need it the most  we will make an historic beginning on the task of defining and protecting the right of personal privacy for every american  and we will start on a new road toward reform of a welfare system that bleeds the taxpayer corrodes the community and demeans those it is intended to assist  and together with the other nations of the world we will establish the economic framework within which americans will share more fully in an expanding worldwide trade and prosperity in the years ahead with more open access to both markets and supplies  in all of the 186 state of the union messages delivered from this place in our history this is the first in which the one priority the first priority is energy let me begin by reporting a new development which i know will be welcome news to every american as you know we have committed ourselves to an active role in helping to achieve a just and durable peace in the middle east on the basis of full implementation of security council resolutions 242 and 338 the first step in the process is the disengagement of egyptian and israeli forces which is now taking place  because of this hopeful development i can announce tonight that i have been assured through my personal contacts with friendly leaders in the middle eastern area that an urgent meeting will be called in the immediate future to discuss the lifting of the oil embargo  this is an encouraging sign however it should be clearly understood by our friends in the middle east that the united states will not be coerced on this issue  regardless of the outcome of this meeting the cooperation of the american people in our energy conservation program has already gone a long way towards achieving a goal to which i am deeply dedicated let us do everything we can to avoid gasoline rationing in the united states of america  last week i sent to the congress a comprehensive special message setting forth our energy situation recommending the legislative measures which are necessary to a program for meeting our needs if the embargo is lifted this will ease the crisis but it will not mean an end to the energy shortage in america voluntary conservation will continue to be necessary and let me take this occasion to pay tribute once again to the splendid spirit of cooperation the american people have shown which has made possible our success in meeting this emergency up to this time  the new legislation i have requested will also remain necessary therefore i urge again that the energy measures that i have proposed be made the first priority of this session of the congress these measures will require the oil companies and other energy producers to provide the public with the necessary information on their supplies they will prevent the injustice of windfall profits for a few as a result of the sacrifices of the millions of americans and they will give us the organization the incentives the authorities needed to deal with the shortterm emergency and to move toward meeting our longterm needs  just as 1970 was the year in which we began a fullscale effort to protect the environment 1974 must be the year in which we organize a fullscale effort to provide for our energy needs not only in this decade but through the 21st century  as we move toward the celebration 2 years from now of the 200th anniversary of this nations independence let us press vigorously on toward the goal i announced last november for project independence let this be our national goal at the end of this decade in the year 1980 the united states will not be dependent on any other country for the energy we need to provide our jobs to heat our homes and to keep our transportation moving  to indicate the size of the government commitment to spur energy research and development we plan to spend 10 billion in federal funds over the next 5 years that is an enormous amount but during the same 5 years private enterprise will be investing as much as 200 billionand in 10 years 500 billionto develop the new resources the new technology the new capacity america will require for its energy needs in the 1980s that is just a measure of the magnitude of the project we are undertaking  but america performs best when called to its biggest tasks it can truly be said that only in america could a task so tremendous be achieved so quickly and achieved not by regimentation but through the effort and ingenuity of a free people working in a free system  turning now to the rest of the agenda for 1974 the time is at hand this year to bring comprehensive high quality health care within the reach of every american i shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health insurance protection to millions of americans who cannot now obtain it or afford it with vastly improved protection against catastrophic illnesses this will be a plan that maintains the high standards of quality in americas health care and it will not require additional taxes  now i recognize that other plans have been put forward that would cost 80 billion or even 100 billion and that would put our whole health care system under the heavy hand of the federal government this is the wrong approach this has been tried abroad and it has failed it is not the way we do things here in america this kind of plan would threaten the quality of care provided by our whole health care system the right way is one that builds on the strengths of the present system and one that does not destroy those strengths one based on partnership not paternalism most important of all let us keep this as the guiding principle of our health programs government has a great role to play but we must always make sure that our doctors will be working for their patients and not for the federal government  many of you will recall that in my state of the union address 3 years ago i commented that most americans today are simply fed up with government at all levels and i recommended a sweeping set of proposals to revitalize state and local governments to make them more responsive to the people they serve i can report to you today that as a result of revenue sharing passed by the congress and other measures we have made progress toward that goal after 40 years of moving power from the states and the communities to washington dc we have begun moving power back from washington to the states and communities and most important to the people of america  in this session of the congress i believe we are near the breakthrough point on efforts which i have suggested proposals to let people themselves make their own decisions for their own communities and in particular on those to provide broad new flexibility in federal aid for community development for economic development for education and i look forward to working with the congress with members of both parties in resolving whatever remaining differences we have in this legislation so that we can make available nearly 5 12 billion to our states and localities to use not for what a federal bureaucrat may want but for what their own people in those communities want the decision should be theirs  i think all of us recognize that the energy crisis has given new urgency to the need to improve public transportation not only in our cities but in rural areas as well the program i have proposed this year will give communities not only more money but also more freedom to balance their own transportation needs it will mark the strongest federal commitment ever to the improvement of mass transit as an essential element of the improvement of life in our towns and cities  one goal on which all americans agree is that our children should have the very best education this great nation can provide  in a special message last week i recommended a number of important new measures that can make 1974 a year of truly significant advances for our schools and for the children they serve if the congress will act on these proposals more flexible funding will enable each federal dollar to meet better the particular need of each particular school district advance funding will give school authorities a chance to make each years plans knowing ahead of time what federal funds they are going to receive special targeting will give special help to the truly disadvantaged among our people college students faced with rising costs for their education will be able to draw on an expanded program of loans and grants these advances are a needed investment in americas most precious resource our next generation and i urge the congress to act on this legislation in 1974  one measure of a truly free society is the vigor with which it protects the liberties of its individual citizens as technology has advanced in america it has increasingly encroached on one of those libertieswhat i term the right of personal privacy modern information systems data banks credit records mailing list abuses electronic snooping the collection of personal data for one purpose that may be used for anotherall these have left millions of americans deeply concerned by the privacy they cherish  and the time has come therefore for a major initiative to define the nature and extent of the basic rights of privacy and to erect new safeguards to ensure that those rights are respected  i shall launch such an effort this year at the highest levels of the administration and i look forward again to working with this congress in establishing a new set of standards that respect the legitimate needs of society but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal principle of american liberty  many of those in this chamber tonight will recall that it was 3 years ago that i termed the nations welfare system a monstrous consuming outragean outrage against the community against the taxpayer and particularly against the children that it is supposed to help  that system is still an outrage by improving its administration we have been able to reduce some of the abuses as a result last year for the first time in 18 years there has been a halt in the growth of the welfare caseload but as a system our welfare program still needs reform as urgently today as it did when i first proposed in 1969 that we completely replace it with a different system  in these final 3 years of my administration i urge the congress to join me in mounting a major new effort to replace the discredited present welfare system with one that works one that is fair to those who need help or cannot help themselves fair to the community and fair to the taxpayer and let us have as our goal that there will be no government program which makes it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work  i recognize that from the debates that have taken place within the congress over the past 3 years on this program that we cannot expect enactment overnight of a new reform but i do propose that the congress and the administration together make this the year in which we discuss debate and shape such a reform so that it can be enacted as quickly as possible  americas own prosperity in the years ahead depends on our sharing fully and equitably in an expanding world prosperity historic negotiations will take place this year that will enable us to ensure fair treatment in international markets for american workers american farmers american investors and american consumers  it is vital that the authorities contained in the trade bill i submitted to the congress be enacted so that the united states can negotiate flexibly and vigorously on behalf of american interests these negotiations can usher in a new era of international trade that not only increases the prosperity of all nations but also strengthens the peace among all nations  in the past 5 years we have made more progress toward a lasting structure of peace in the world than in any comparable time in the nations history we could not have made that progress if we had not maintained the military strength of america thomas jefferson once observed that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance by the same token and for the same reason in todays world the price of peace is a strong defense as far as the united states is concerned  in the past 5 years we have steadily reduced the burden of national defense as a share of the budget bringing it down from 44 percent in 1969 to 29 percent in the current year we have cut our military manpower over the past 5 years by more than a third from 35 million to 22 million  in the coming year however increased expenditures will be needed they will be needed to assure the continued readiness of our military forces to preserve present force levels in the face of rising costs and to give us the military strength we must have if our security is to be maintained and if our initiatives for peace are to succeed  the question is not whether we can afford to maintain the necessary strength of our defense the question is whether we can afford not to maintain it and the answer to that question is no we must never allow america to become the second strongest nation in the world  i do not say this with any sense of belligerence because i recognize the fact that is recognized around the world americas military strength has always been maintained to keep the peace never to break it it has always been used to defend freedom never to destroy it the worlds peace as well as our own depends on our remaining as strong as we need to be as long as we need to be  in this year 1974 we will be negotiating with the soviet union to place further limits on strategic nuclear arms together with our allies we will be negotiating with the nations of the warsaw pact on mutual and balanced reduction of forces in europe and we will continue our efforts to promote peaceful economic development in latin america in africa in asia we will press for full compliance with the peace accords that brought an end to american fighting in indochina including particularly a provision that promised the fullest possible accounting for those americans who are missing in action  and having in mind the energy crisis to which i have referred to earlier we will be working with the other nations of the world toward agreement on means by which oil supplies can be assured at reasonable prices on a stable basis in a fair way to the consuming and producing nations alike  all of these are steps toward a future in which the worlds peace and prosperity and ours as well as a result are made more secure  throughout the 5 years that i have served as your president i have had one overriding aim and that was to establish a new structure of peace in the world that can free future generations of the scourge of war i can understand that others may have different priorities this has been and this will remain my first priority and the chief legacy i hope to leave from the 8 years of my presidency  this does not mean that we shall not have other priorities because as we strengthen the peace we must also continue each year a steady strengthening of our society here at home our conscience requires it our interests require it and we must insist upon it  as we create more jobs as we build a better health care system as we improve our education as we develop new sources of energy as we provide more abundantly for the elderly and the poor as we strengthen the system of private enterprise that produces our prosperityas we do all of this and even more we solidify those essential bonds that hold us together as a nation  even more importantly we advance what in the final analysis government in america is all about  what it is all about is more freedom more security a better life for each one of the 211 million people that live in this land  we cannot afford to neglect progress at home while pursuing peace abroad but neither can we afford to neglect peace abroad while pursuing progress at home with a stable peace all is possible but without peace nothing is possible  in the written message that i have just delivered to the speaker and to the president of the senate i commented that one of the continuing challenges facing us in the legislative process is that of the timing and pacing of our initiatives selecting each year among many worthy projects those that are ripe for action at that time  what is true in terms of our domestic initiatives is true also in the world this period we now are in in the worldand i say this as one who has seen so much of the world not only in these past 5 years but going back over many yearswe are in a period which presents a juncture of historic forces unique in this century they provide an opportunity we may never have again to create a structure of peace solid enough to last a lifetime and more not just peace in our time but peace in our childrens time as well it is on the way we respond to this opportunity more than anything else that history will judge whether we in america have met our responsibility and i am confident we will meet that great historic responsibility which is ours today  it was 27 years ago that john f kennedy and i sat in this chamber as freshmen congressmen hearing our first state of the union address delivered by harry truman i know from my talks with him as members of the labor committee on which we both served that neither of us then even dreamed that either one or both might eventually be standing in this place that i now stand in now and that he once stood in before me it may well be that one of the freshmen members of the 93d congress one of you out there will deliver his own state of the union message 27 years from now in the year 2001  well whichever one it is i want you to be able to look back with pride and to say that your first years here were great years and recall that you were here in this 93d congress when america ended its longest war and began its longest peace  mr speaker and mr president and my distinguished colleagues and our guests i would like to add a personal word with regard to an issue that has been of great concern to all americans over the past year i refer of course to the investigations of the socalled watergate affair as you know i have provided to the special prosecutor voluntarily a great deal of material i believe that i have provided all the material that he needs to conclude his investigations and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to clear the innocent  i believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other investigations of this matter to an end one year of watergate is enough  and the time has come my colleagues for not only the executive the president but the members of congress for all of us to join together in devoting our full energies to these great issues that i have discussed tonight which involve the welfare of all of the american people in so many different ways as well as the peace of the world  i recognize that the house judiciary committee has a special responsibility in this area and i want to indicate on this occasion that i will cooperate with the judiciary committee in its investigation i will cooperate so that it can conclude its investigation make its decision and i will cooperate in any way that i consider consistent with my responsibilities to the office of the presidency of the united states  there is only one limitation i will follow the precedent that has been followed by and defended by every president from george washington to lyndon b johnson of never doing anything that weakens the office of the president of the united states or impairs the ability of the presidents of the future to make the great decisions that are so essential to this nation and the world  another point i should like to make very briefly like every member of the house and senate assembled here tonight i was elected to the office that i hold and like every member of the house and senate when i was elected to that office i knew that i was elected for the purpose of doing a job and doing it as well as i possibly can and i want you to know that i have no intention whatever of ever walking away from the job that the people elected me to do for the people of the united states  now needless to say it would be understatement if i were not to admit that the year 1973 was not a very easy year for me personally or for my family and as i have already indicated the year 1974 presents very great and serious problems as very great and serious opportunities are also presented  but my colleagues this i believe with the help of god who has blessed this land so richly with the cooperation of the congress and with the support of the american people we can and we will make the year 1974 a year of unprecedented progress toward our goal of building a structure of lasting peace in the world and a new prosperity without war in the united states of america  
183, State of the Union Address, Gerald R. Ford,1975-01-15,  mr speaker mr vice president members of the 94th congress and distinguished guests  twentysix years ago a freshman congressman a young fellow with lots of idealism who was out to change the world stood before sam rayburn in the well of the house and solemnly swore to the same oath that all of you took yesterdayan unforgettable experience and i congratulate you all  two days later that same freshman stood at the back of this great chamberover there someplaceas president truman all charged up by his singlehanded election victory reported as the constitution requires on the state of the union  when the bipartisan applause stopped president truman said i am happy to report to this 81st congress that the state of the union is good our nation is better able than ever before to meet the needs of the american people and to give them their fair chance in the pursuit of happiness it is foremost among the nations of the world in the search for peace  today that freshman member from michigan stands where mr truman stood and i must say to you that the state of the union is not good  millions of americans are out of work  recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more  prices are too high and sales are too slow  this years federal deficit will be about 30 billion next years probably 45 billion  the national debt will rise to over 500 billion  our plant capacity and productivity are not increasing fast enough  we depend on others for essential energy  some people question their governments ability to make hard decisions and stick with them they expect washington politics as usual  yet what president truman said on january 5 1949 is even more true in 1975 we are better able to meet our peoples needs all americans do have a fairer chance to pursue happiness not only are we still the foremost nation in the pursuit of peace but todays prospects of attaining it are infinitely brighter  there were 59 million americans employed at the start of 1949 now there are more than 85 million americans who have jobs in comparable dollars the average income of the american family has doubled during the past 26 years  now i want to speak very bluntly ive got bad news and i dont expect much if any applause the american people want action and it will take both the congress and the president to give them what they want progress and solutions can be achieved and they will be achieved  my message today is not intended to address all of the complex needs of america i will send separate messages making specific recommendations for domestic legislation such as the extension of general revenue sharing and the voting rights act  the moment has come to move in a new direction we can do this by fashioning a new partnership between the congress on the one hand the white house on the other and the people we both represent  let us mobilize the most powerful and most creative industrial nation that ever existed on this earth to put all our people to work the emphasis on our economic efforts must now shift from inflation to jobs  to bolster business and industry and to create new jobs i propose a 1year tax reduction of 16 billion threequarters would go to individuals and onequarter to promote business investment  this cash rebate to individuals amounts to 12 percent of 1974 tax paymentsa total cut of 12 billion with a maximum of 1000 per return  i call on the congress to act by april 1 if you doand i hope you willthe treasury can send the first check for half of the rebate in may and the second by september  the other onefourth of the cut about 4 billion will go to business including farms to promote expansion and to create more jobs the 1year reduction for businesses would be in the form of a liberalized investment tax credit increasing the rate to 12 percent for all businesses  this tax cut does not include the more fundamental reforms needed in our tax system but it points us in the right directionallowing taxpayers rather than the government to spend their pay  cutting taxes now is essential if we are to turn the economy around a tax cut offers the best hope of creating more jobs unfortunately it will increase the size of the budget deficit therefore it is more important than ever that we take steps to control the growth of federal expenditures  part of our trouble is that we have been selfindulgent for decades we have been voting everincreasing levels of government benefits and now the bill has come due we have been adding so many new programs that the size and the growth of the federal budget has taken on a life of its own  one characteristic of these programs is that their cost increases automatically every year because the number of people eligible for most of the benefits increases every year when these programs are enacted there is no dollar amount set no one knows what they will cost all we know is that whatever they cost last year they will cost more next year  it is a question of simple arithmetic unless we check the excessive growth of federal expenditures or impose on ourselves matching increases in taxes we will continue to run huge inflationary deficits in the federal budget  if we project the current builtin momentum of federal spending through the next 15 years state federal and local government expenditures could easily comprise half of our gross national product this compares with less than a third in 1975  i have just concluded the process of preparing the budget submissions for fiscal year 1976 in that budget i will propose legislation to restrain the growth of a number of existing programs i have also concluded that no new spending programs can be initiated this year except for energy further i will not hesitate to veto any new spending programs adopted by the congress  as an additional step toward putting the federal governments house in order i recommend a 5percent limit on federal pay increases in 1975 in all government programs tied to the consumer price indexincluding social security civil service and military retirement pay and food stampsi also propose a 1year maximum increase of 5 percent  none of these recommended ceiling limitations over which congress has final authority are easy to propose because in most cases they involve anticipated payments to many many deserving people nonetheless it must be done i must emphasize that i am not asking to eliminate to reduce to freeze these payments i am merely recommending that we slow down the rate at which these payments increase and these programs grow  only a reduction in the growth of spending can keep federal borrowing down and reduce the damage to the private sector from high interest rates only a reduction in spending can make it possible for the federal reserve system to avoid an inflationary growth in the money supply and thus restore balance to our economy a major reduction in the growth of federal spending can help dispel the uncertainty that so many feel about our economy and put us on the way to curing our economic ills  if we dont act to slow down the rate of increase in federal spending the united states treasury will be legally obligated to spend more than 360 billion in fiscal year 1976 even if no new programs are enacted these are not matters of conjecture or prediction but again a matter of simple arithmetic the size of these numbers and their implications for our everyday life and the health of our economic system are shocking  i submitted to the last congress a list of budget deferrals and rescissions there will be more cuts recommended in the budget that i will submit even so the level of outlays for fiscal year 1976 is still much much too high not only is it too high for this year but the decisions we make now will inevitably have a major and growing impact on expenditure levels in future years i think this is a very fundamental issue that we the congress and i must jointly solve  economic disruptions we and others are experiencing stem in part from the fact that the world price of petroleum has quadrupled in the last year but in all honesty we cannot put all of the blame on the oilexporting nations we the united states are not blameless our growing dependence upon foreign sources has been adding to our vulnerability for years and years and we did nothing to prepare ourselves for such an event as the embargo of 1973  during the 1960s this country had a surplus capacity of crude oil which we were able to make available to our trading partners whenever there was a disruption of supply this surplus capacity enabled us to influence both supplies and prices of crude oil throughout the world our excess capacity neutralized any effort at establishing an effective cartel and thus the rest of the world was assured of adequate supplies of oil at reasonable prices  by 1970 our surplus capacity had vanished and as a consequence the latent power of the oil cartel could emerge in full force europe and japan both heavily dependent on imported oil now struggle to keep their economies in balance even the united states our country which is far more selfsufficient than most other industrial countries has been put under serious pressure  i am proposing a program which will begin to restore our countrys surplus capacity in total energy in this way we will be able to assure ourselves reliable and adequate energy and help foster a new world energy stability for other major consuming nations  but this nation and in fact the world must face the prospect of energy difficulties between now and 1985 this program will impose burdens on all of us with the aim of reducing our consumption of energy and increasing our production great attention has been paid to the considerations of fairness and i can assure you that the burdens will not fall more harshly on those less able to bear them  i am recommending a plan to make us invulnerable to cutoffs of foreign oil it will require sacrifices but itand this is most importantit will work  i have set the following national energy goals to assure that our future is as secure and as productive as our past  first we must reduce oil imports by 1 million barrels per day by the end of this year and by 2 million barrels per day by the end of 1977  second we must end vulnerability to economic disruption by foreign suppliers by 1985  third we must develop our energy technology and resources so that the united states has the ability to supply a significant share of the energy needs of the free world by the end of this century  to attain these objectives we need immediate action to cut imports unfortunately in the short term there are only a limited number of actions which can increase domestic supply i will press for all of them  i urge quick action on the necessary legislation to allow commercial production at the elk hills california naval petroleum reserve in order that we make greater use of domestic coal resources i am submitting amendments to the energy supply and environmental coordination act which will greatly increase the number of powerplants that can be promptly converted to coal  obviously voluntary conservation continues to be essential but tougher programs are neededand needed now therefore i am using presidential powers to raise the fee on all imported crude oil and petroleum products the crude oil fee level will be increased 1 per barrel on february 1 by 2 per barrel on march 1 and by 3 per barrel on april 1 i will take actions to reduce undue hardships on any geographical region the foregoing are interim administrative actions they will be rescinded when the broader but necessary legislation is enacted  to that end i am requesting the congress to act within 90 days on a more comprehensive energy tax program it includes excise taxes and import fees totaling 2 per barrel on product imports and on all crude oil deregulation of new natural gas and enactment of a natural gas excise tax  i plan to take presidential initiative to decontrol the price of domestic crude oil on april 1 i urge the congress to enact a windfall profits tax by that date to ensure that oil producers do not profit unduly  the sooner congress acts the more effective the oil conservation program will be and the quicker the federal revenues can be returned to our people  i am prepared to use presidential authority to limit imports as necessary to guarantee success  i want you to know that before deciding on my energy conservation program i considered rationing and higher gasoline taxes as alternatives in my judgment neither would achieve the desired results and both would produce unacceptable inequities  a massive program must be initiated to increase energy supply to cut demand and provide new standby emergency programs to achieve the independence we want by 1985 the largest part of increased oil production must come from new frontier areas on the outer continental shelf and from the naval petroleum reserve no 4 in alaska it is the intent of this administration to move ahead with exploration leasing and production on those frontier areas of the outer continental shelf where the environmental risks are acceptable  use of our most abundant domestic resourcecoalis severely limited we must strike a reasonable compromise on environmental concerns with coal i am submitting clean air amendments which will allow greater coal use without sacrificing clean air goals  i vetoed the strip mining legislation passed by the last congress with appropriate changes i will sign a revised version when it comes to the white house  i am proposing a number of actions to energize our nuclear power program i will submit legislation to expedite nuclear leasing and the rapid selection of sites  in recent months utilities have cancelled or postponed over 60 percent of planned nuclear expansion and 30 percent of planned additions to nonnuclear capacity financing problems for that industry are worsening i am therefore recommending that the 1year investment tax credit of 12 percent be extended an additional 2 years to specifically speed the construction of powerplants that do not use natural gas or oil i am also submitting proposals for selective reform of state utility commission regulations  to provide the critical stability for our domestic energy production in the face of world price uncertainty i will request legislation to authorize and require tariffs import quotas or price floors to protect our energy prices at levels which will achieve energy independence  increasing energy supplies is not enough we must take additional steps to cut longterm consumption i therefore propose to the congress legislation to make thermal efficiency standards mandatory for all new buildings in the united states a new tax credit of up to 150 for those homeowners who install insulation equipment the establishment of an energy conservation program to help lowincome families purchase insulation supplies legislation to modify and defer automotive pollution standards for 5 years which will enable us to improve automobile gas mileage by 40 percent by 1980  these proposals and actions cumulatively can reduce our dependence on foreign energy supplies from 3 to 5 million barrels per day by 1985 to make the united states invulnerable to foreign disruption i propose standby emergency legislation and a strategic storage program of 1 billion barrels of oil for domestic needs and 300 million barrels for national defense purposes  i will ask for the funds needed for energy research and development activities i have established a goal of 1 million barrels of synthetic fuels and shale oil production per day by 1985 together with an incentive program to achieve it  i have a very deep belief in americas capabilities within the next 10 years my program envisions 200 major nuclear powerplants 250 major new coal mines 150 major coalfired powerplants 30 major new refineries 20 major new synthetic fuel plants the drilling of many thousands of new oil wells the insulation of 18 million homes and the manufacturing and the sale of millions of new automobiles trucks and buses that use much less fuel  i happen to believe that we can do it in another crisisthe one in 1942 president franklin d roosevelt said this country would build 60000 military aircraft by 1943 production in that program had reached 125000 aircraft annually they did it then we can do it now  if the congress and the american people will work with me to attain these targets they will be achieved and will be surpassed from adversity let us seize opportunity revenues of some 30 billion from higher energy taxes designed to encourage conservation must be refunded to the american people in a manner which corrects distortions in our tax system wrought by inflation  people have been pushed into higher tax brackets by inflation with consequent reduction in their actual spending power business taxes are similarly distorted because inflation exaggerates reported profits resulting in excessive taxes  accordingly i propose that future individual income taxes be reduced by 165 billion this will be done by raising the lowincome allowance and reducing tax rates this continuing tax cut will primarily benefit lower and middleincome taxpayers  for example a typical family of four with a gross income of 5600 now pays 185 in federal income taxes under this tax cut plan they would pay nothing a family of four with a gross income of 12500 now pays 1260 in federal taxes my proposal reduces that total by 300 families grossing 20000 would receive a reduction of 210  those with the very lowest incomes who can least afford higher costs must also be compensated i propose a payment of 80 to every person 18 years of age and older in that very limited category  state and local governments will receive 2 billion in additional revenue sharing to offset their increased energy costs  to offset inflationary distortions and to generate more economic activity the corporate tax rate will be reduced from 48 percent to 42 percent  now let me turn if i might to the international dimension of the present crisis at no time in our peacetime history has the state of the nation depended more heavily on the state of the world and seldom if ever has the state of the world depended more heavily on the state of our nation  the economic distress is global we will not solve it at home unless we help to remedy the profound economic dislocation abroad world trade and monetary structure provides markets energy food and vital raw materialsfor all nations this international system is now in jeopardy  this nation can be proud of significant achievements in recent years in solving problems and crises the berlin agreement the salt agreements our new relationship with china the unprecedented efforts in the middle east are immensely encouraging but the world is not free from crisis in a world of 150 nations where nuclear technology is proliferating and regional conflicts continue international security cannot be taken for granted  so let there be no mistake about it international cooperation is a vital factor of our lives today this is not a moment for the american people to turn inward more than ever before our own wellbeing depends on americas determination and americas leadership in the whole wide world  we are a great nationspiritually politically militarily diplomatically and economically americas commitment to international security has sustained the safety of allies and friends in many areasin the middle east in europe and in asia our turning away would unleash new instabilities new dangers around the globe which in turn would threaten our own security  at the end of world war ii we turned a similar challenge into an historic opportunity and i might add an historic achievement an old order was in disarray political and economic institutions were shattered in that period this nation and its partners built new institutions new mechanisms of mutual support and cooperation today as then we face an historic opportunity if we act imaginatively and boldly as we acted then this period will in retrospect be seen as one of the great creative moments of our nations history the whole world is watching to see how we respond  a resurgent american economy would do more to restore the confidence of the world in its own future than anything else we can do the program that this congress passes can demonstrate to the world that we have started to put our own house in order if we can show that this nation is able and willing to help other nations meet the common challenge it can demonstrate that the united states will fulfill its responsibilities as a leader among nations  quite frankly at stake is the future of industrialized democracies which have perceived their destiny in common and sustained it in common for 30 years  the developing nations are also at a turning point the poorest nations see their hopes of feeding their hungry and developing their societies shattered by the economic crisis the longterm economic future for the producers of raw materials also depends on cooperative solutions  our relations with the communist countries are a basic factor of the world environment we must seek to build a longterm basis for coexistence we will stand by our principles we will stand by our interests we will act firmly when challenged the kind of a world we want depends on a broad policy of creating mutual incentives for restraint and for cooperation  as we move forward to meet our global challenges and opportunities we must have the tools to do the job  our military forces are strong and ready this military strength deters aggression against our allies stabilizes our relations with former adversaries and protects our homeland fully adequate conventional and strategic forces cost many many billions but these dollars are sound insurance for our safety and for a more peaceful world  military strength alone is not sufficient effective diplomacy is also essential in preventing conflict in building world understanding the vladivostok negotiations with the soviet union represent a major step in moderating strategic arms competition my recent discussions with the leaders of the atlantic community japan and south korea have contributed to meeting the common challenge  but we have serious problems before us that require cooperation between the president and the congress by the constitution and tradition the execution of foreign policy is the responsibility of the president  in recent years under the stress of the vietnam war legislative restrictions on the presidents ability to execute foreign policy and military decisions have proliferated as a member of the congress i opposed some and i approved others as president i welcome the advice and cooperation of the house and the senate  but if our foreign policy is to be successful we cannot rigidly restrict in legislation the ability of the president to act the conduct of negotiations is illsuited to such limitations legislative restrictions intended for the best motives and purposes can have the opposite result as we have seen most recently in our trade relations with the soviet union  for my part i pledge this administration will act in the closest consultation with the congress as we face delicate situations and troubled times throughout the globe  when i became president only 5 months ago i promised the last congress a policy of communication conciliation compromise and cooperation i renew that pledge to the new members of this congress  let me sum it up america needs a new direction which i have sought to chart here todaya change of course which will put the unemployed back to work increase real income and production restrain the growth of federal government spending achieve energy independence and advance the cause of world understanding  we have the ability we have the knowhow in partnership with the american people we will achieve these objectives  as our 200th anniversary approaches we owe it to ourselves and to posterity to rebuild our political and economic strength let us make america once again and for centuries more to come what it has so long beena stronghold and a beaconlight of liberty for the whole world  thank you  
184, State of the Union Address, Gerald R. Ford,1976-01-19,  mr speaker mr vice president members of the 94th congress and distinguished guests  as we begin our bicentennial america is still one of the youngest nations in recorded history long before our forefathers came to these shores men and women had been struggling on this planet to forge a better life for themselves and their families  in mans long upward march from savagery and slaverythroughout the nearly 2000 years of the christian calendar the nearly 6000 years of jewish reckoningthere have been many deep terrifying valleys but also many bright and towering peaks  one peak stands highest in the ranges of human history one example shines forth of a people uniting to produce abundance and to share the good life fairly and with freedom one union holds out the promise of justice and opportunity for every citizen that union is the united states of america  we have not remade paradise on earth we know perfection will not be found here but think for a minute how far we have come in 200 years  we came from many roots and we have many branches yet all americans across the eight generations that separate us from the stirring deeds of 1776 those who know no other homeland and those who just found refuge among our shores say in unison  i am proud of america and i am proud to be an american life will be a little better here for my children than for me i believe this not because i am told to believe it but because life has been better for me than it was for my father and my mother i know it will be better for my children because my hands my brains my voice and my vote can help make it happen  it has happened here in america it has happened to you and to me government exists to create and preserve conditions in which people can translate their ideas into practical reality in the best of times much is lost in translation but we try sometimes we have tried and failed always we have had the best of intentions  but in the recent past we sometimes forgot the sound principles that guided us through most of our history we wanted to accomplish great things and solve ageold problems and we became overconfident of our abilities we tried to be a policeman abroad and the indulgent parent here at home  we thought we could transform the country through massive national programs but often the programs did not work too often they only made things worse in our rush to accomplish great deeds quickly we trampled on sound principles of restraint and endangered the rights of individuals we unbalanced our economic system by the huge and unprecedented growth of federal expenditures and borrowing and we were not totally honest with ourselves about how much these programs would cost and how we would pay for them finally we shifted our emphasis from defense to domestic problems while our adversaries continued a massive buildup of arms  the time has now come for a fundamentally different approach for a new realism that is true to the great principles upon which this nation was founded  we must introduce a new balance to our economya balance that favors not only sound active government but also a much more vigorous healthy economy that can create new jobs and hold down prices  we must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual and the governmenta balance that favors greater individual freedom and selfreliance  we must strike a new balance in our system of federalisma balance that favors greater responsibility and freedom for the leaders of our state and local governments  we must introduce a new balance between the spending on domestic programs and spending on defensea balance that ensures we will fully meet our obligation to the needy while also protecting our security in a world that is still hostile to freedom  and in all that we do we must be more honest with the american people promising them no more than we can deliver and delivering all that we promise  the genius of america has been its incredible ability to improve the lives of its citizens through a unique combination of governmental and free citizen activity  history and experience tells us that moral progress cannot come in comfortable and in complacent times but out of trial and out of confusion tom paine aroused the troubled americans of 1776 to stand up to the times that try mens souls because the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph  just a year ago i reported that the state of the union was not good tonight i report that the state of our union is betterin many ways a lot betterbut still not good enough  to paraphrase tom paine 1975 was not a year for summer soldiers and sunshine patriots it was a year of fears and alarms and of dire forecastsmost of which never happened and wont happen  as you recall the year 1975 opened with rancor and with bitterness political misdeeds of the past had neither been forgotten nor forgiven the longest most divisive war in our history was winding toward an unhappy conclusion many feared that the end of that foreign war of men and machines meant the beginning of a domestic war of recrimination and reprisal friends and adversaries abroad were asking whether america had lost its nerve finally our economy was ravaged by inflationinflation that was plunging us into the worst recession in four decades at the same time americans became increasingly alienated from big institutions they were steadily losing confidence not just in big government but in big business big labor and big education among others ours was a troubled land  and so 1975 was a year of hard decisions difficult compromises and a new realism that taught us something important about america it brought back a needed measure of common sense steadfastness and selfdiscipline  americans did not panic or demand instant but useless cures in all sectors people met their difficult problems with the restraint and with responsibility worthy of their great heritage  add up the separate pieces of progress in 1975 subtract the setbacks and the sum total shows that we are not only headed in a new direction a direction which i proposed 12 months ago but it turned out to be the right direction  it is the right direction because it follows the truly revolutionary american concept of 1776 which holds that in a free society the making of public policy and successful problemsolving involves much more than government it involves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of government private institutions and individual citizens  common sense tells me to stick to that steady course  take the state of our economy last january most things were rapidly getting worse this january most things are slowly but surely getting better  the worst recession since world war ii turned around in april the best costofliving news of the past year is that doubledigit inflation of 12 percent or higher was cut almost in half the worstunemployment remains far too high  today nearly 1700000 more americans are working than at the bottom of the recession at years end people were again being hired much faster than they were being laid off  yet lets be honest many americans have not yet felt these changes in their daily lives they still see prices going up far too fast and they still know the fear of unemployment  we are also a growing nation we need more and more jobs every year todays economy has produced over 85 million jobs for americans but we need a lot more jobs especially for the young  my first objective is to have sound economic growth without inflation  we all know from recent experience what runaway inflation does to ruin every other worthy purpose we are slowing it we must stop it cold  for many americans the way to a healthy noninflationary economy has become increasingly apparent the government must stop spending so much and stop borrowing so much of our money more money must remain in private hands where it will do the most good to hold down the cost of living we must hold down the cost of government  in the past decade the federal budget has been growing at an average rate of over 10 percent a year the budget i am submitting wednesday cuts this rate of growth in half i have kept my promise to submit a budget for the next fiscal year of 395 billion in fact it is 3942 billion  by holding down the growth of federal spending we can afford additional tax cuts and return to the people who pay taxes more decisionmaking power over their own lives  last month i signed legislation to extend the 1975 tax reductions for the first 6 months of this year i now propose that effective july 1 1976 we give our taxpayers a tax cut of approximately 10 billion more than congress agreed to in december  my broader tax reduction would mean that for a family of four making 15000 a year there will be 227 more in takehome pay annually hardworking americans caught in the middle can really use that kind of extra cash  my recommendations for a firm restraint on the growth of federal spending and for greater tax reduction are simple and straightforward for every dollar saved in cutting the growth in the federal budget we can have an added dollar of federal tax reduction  we can achieve a balanced budget by 1979 if we have the courage and the wisdom to continue to reduce the growth of federal spending  one test of a healthy economy is a job for every american who wants to work governmentour kind of governmentcannot create that many jobs but the federal government can create conditions and incentives for private business and industry to make more and more jobs  five out of six jobs in this country are in private business and in industry common sense tells us this is the place to look for more jobs and to find them faster i mean real rewarding permanent jobs  to achieve this we must offer the american people greater incentives to invest in the future my tax proposals are a major step in that direction to supplement these proposals i ask that congress enact changes in federal tax laws that will speed up plant expansion and the purchase of new equipment my recommendations will concentrate this jobcreation tax incentive in areas where the unemployment rate now runs over 7 percent legislation to get this started must be approved at the earliest possible date  within the strict budget total that i will recommend for the coming year i will ask for additional housing assistance for 500000 families these programs will expand housing opportunities spur construction and help to house moderate and lowincome families  we had a disappointing year in the housing industry in 1975 but with lower interest rates and available mortgage money we can have a healthy recovery in 1976  a necessary condition of a healthy economy is freedom from the petty tyranny of massive government regulation we are wasting literally millions of working hours costing billions of taxpayers and consumers dollars because of bureaucratic redtape the american farmer who now feeds 215 million americans but also millions worldwide has shown how much more he can produce without the shackles of government control  now we badly need reforms in other key areas in our economy the airlines trucking railroads and financial institutions i have submitted concrete plans in each of these areas not to help this or that industry but to foster competition and to bring prices down for the consumer  this administration in addition will strictly enforce the federal antitrust laws for the very same purposes  taking a longer look at americas future there can be neither sustained growth nor more jobs unless we continue to have an assured supply of energy to run our economy domestic production of oil and gas is still declining our dependence on foreign oil at high prices is still too great draining jobs and dollars away from our own economy at the rate of 125 per year for every american  last month i signed a compromise national energy bill which enacts a part of my comprehensive energy independence program this legislation was late not the complete answer to energy independence but still a start in the right direction  i again urge the congress to move ahead immediately on the remainder of my energy proposals to make america invulnerable to the foreign oil cartel  my proposals as all of you know would reduce domestic natural gas shortages allow production from federal petroleum reserves stimulate effective conservation including revitalization of our railroads and the expansion of our urban transportation systems develop more and cleaner energy from our vast coal resources expedite clean and safe nuclear power production create a new national energy independence authority to stimulate vital energy investment and accelerate development of technology to capture energy from the sun and the earth for this and future generations  also i ask for the sake of future generations that we preserve the family farm and familyowned small business both strengthen america and give stability to our economy i will propose estate tax changes so that family businesses and family farms can be handed down from generation to generation without having to be sold to pay taxes  i propose tax changes to encourage people to invest in americas future and their own through a plan that gives moderateincome families income tax benefits if they make longterm investments in common stock in american companies  the federal government must and will respond to clearcut national needsfor this and future generations  hospital and medical services in america are among the best in the world but the cost of a serious and extended illness can quickly wipe out a familys lifetime savings increasing health costs are of deep concern to all and a powerful force pushing up the cost of living the burden of catastrophic illness can be borne by very few in our society we must eliminate this fear from every family  i propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody covered by medicare to finance this added protection fees for shortterm care will go up somewhat but nobody after reaching age 65 will have to pay more than 500 a year for covered hospital or nursing home care nor more than 250 for 1 years doctor bills  we cannot realistically afford federally dictated national health insurance providing full coverage for all 215 million americans the experience of other countries raises questions about the quality as well as the cost of such plans but i do envision the day when we may use the private health insurance system to offer more middleincome families high quality health services at prices they can afford and shield them also from their catastrophic illnesses  using resources now available i propose improving the medicare and other federal health programs to help those who really need protectionolder people and the poor to help states and local governments give better health care to the poor i propose that we combine 16 existing federal programs including medicaid into a single 10 billion federal grant  funds would be divided among states under a new formula which provides a larger share of federal money to those states that have a larger share of lowincome families  i will take further steps to improve the quality of medical and hospital care for those who have served in our armed forces  now let me speak about social security our federal social security system for people who have worked and contributed to it for all their lives is a vital part of our economic system its value is no longer debatable in my budget for fiscal year 1977 i am recommending that the full costofliving increases in the social security benefits be paid during the coming year  but i am concerned about the integrity of our social security trust fund that enables peoplethose retired and those still working who will retireto count on this source of retirement income younger workers watch their deductions rise and wonder if they will be adequately protected in the future we must meet this challenge head on simple arithmetic warns all of us that the social security trust fund is headed for trouble unless we act soon to make sure the fund takes in as much as it pays out there will be no security for old or for young  i must therefore recommend a threetenths of 1 percent increase in both employer and employee social security taxes effective january 1 1977 this will cost each covered employee less than 1 extra dollar a week and will ensure the integrity of the trust fund  as we rebuild our economy we have a continuing responsibility to provide a temporary cushion to the unemployed at my request the congress enacted two extensions and two expansions in unemployment insurance which helped those who were jobless during 1975 these programs will continue in 1976  in my fiscal year 1977 budget i am also requesting funds to continue proven job training and employment opportunity programs for millions of other americans  compassion and a sense of communitytwo of americas greatest strengths throughout our historytell us we must take care of our neighbors who cannot take care of themselves the host of federal programs in this field reflect our generosity as a people  but everyone realizes that when it comes to welfare government at all levels is not doing the job well too many of our welfare programs are inequitable and invite abuse too many of our welfare programs have problems from beginning to end worse we are wasting badly needed resources without reaching many of the truly needy  complex welfare programs cannot be reformed overnight surely we cannot simply dump welfare into the laps of the 50 states their local taxpayers or their private charities and just walk away from it nor is it the right time for massive and sweeping changes while we are still recovering from the recession  nevertheless there are still plenty of improvements that we can make i will ask congress for presidential authority to tighten up the rules for eligibility and benefits  last year i twice sought long overdue reform of the scandalriddled food stamp program this year i say again lets give food stamps to those most in need lets not give any to those who dont need them  protecting the life and property of the citizen at home is the responsibility of all public officials but is primarily the job of local and state law enforcement authorities  americans have always found the very thought of a federal police force repugnant and so do i but there are proper ways in which we can help to insure domestic tranquility as the constitution charges us  my recommendations on how to control violent crime were submitted to the congress last june with strong emphasis on protecting the innocent victims of crime to keep a convicted criminal from committing more crimes we must put him in prison so he cannot harm more lawabiding citizens to be effective this punishment must be swift and it must be certain  too often criminals are not sent to prison after conviction but are allowed to return to the streets some judges are reluctant to send convicted criminals to prison because of inadequate facilities to alleviate this problem at the federal level my new budget proposes the construction of four new federal facilities  to speed federal justice i propose an increase this year in the united states attorneys prosecuting federal crimes and the reinforcement of the number of united states marshals additional federal judges are needed as recommended by me and the judicial conference  another major threat to every americans person and property is the criminal carrying a handgun the way to cut down on the criminal use of guns is not to take guns away from the lawabiding citizen but to impose mandatory sentences for crimes in which a gun is used make it harder to obtain cheap guns for criminal purposes and concentrate gun control enforcement in highcrime areas  my budget recommends 500 additional federal agents in the 11 largest metropolitan highcrime areas to help local authorities stop criminals from selling and using handguns  the sale of hard drugs is tragically on the increase again i have directed all agencies of the federal government to step up law enforcement efforts against those who deal in drugs in 1975 i am glad to report federal agents seized substantially more heroin coming into our country than in 1974  as president i have talked personally with the leaders of mexico colombia and turkey to urge greater efforts by their governments to control effectively the production and shipment of hard drugs  i recommended months ago that the congress enact mandatory fixed sentences for persons convicted of federal crimes involving the sale of hard drugs hard drugs we all know degrade the spirit as they destroy the body of their users  it is unrealistic and misleading to hold out the hope that the federal government can move into every neighborhood and clean up crime under the constitution the greatest responsibility for curbing crime lies with state and local authorities they are the frontline fighters in the war against crime  there are definite ways in which the federal government can help them i will propose in the new budget that congress authorize almost 7 billion over the next 5 years to assist state and local governments to protect the safety and property of all their citizens  as president i pledge the strict enforcement of federal laws andby example support and leadershipto help state and local authorities enforce their laws together we must protect the victims of crime and ensure domestic tranquility  last year i strongly recommended a 5year extension of the existing revenue sharing legislation which thus far has provided 23 12 billion to help state and local units of government solve problems at home this program has been effective with decisionmaking transferred from the federal government to locally elected officials congress must act this year or state and local units of government will have to drop programs or raise local taxes  including my health care program reforms i propose to consolidate some 59 separate federal programs and provide flexible federal dollar grants to help states cities and local agencies in such important areas as education child nutrition and social services this flexible system will do the job better and do it closer to home  the protection of the lives and property of americans from foreign enemies is one of my primary responsibilities as president  in a world of instant communications and intercontinental ballistic missiles in a world economy that is global and interdependent our relations with other nations become more not less important to the lives of americans  america has had a unique role in the world since the day of our independence 200 years ago and ever since the end of world war ii we have bornesuccessfullya heavy responsibility for ensuring a stable world order and hope for human progress  today the state of our foreign policy is sound and strong we are at peace and i will do all in my power to keep it that way  our military forces are capable and ready our military power is without equal and i intend to keep it that way  our principal alliances with the industrial democracies of the atlantic community and japan have never been more solid  a further agreement to limit the strategic arms race may be achieved  we have an improving relationship with china the worlds most populous nation  the key elements for peace among the nations of the middle east now exist our traditional friendships in latin america africa and asia continue  we have taken the role of leadership in launching a serious and hopeful dialog between the industrial world and the developing world  we have helped to achieve significant reform of the international monetary system  we should be proud of what america what our country has accomplished in these areas and i believe the american people are  the american people have heard too much about how terrible our mistakes how evil our deeds and how misguided our purposes the american people know better  the truth is we are the worlds greatest democracy we remain the symbol of mans aspiration for liberty and wellbeing we are the embodiment of hope for progress  i say it is time we quit downgrading ourselves as a nation of course it is our responsibility to learn the right lesson from past mistakes it is our duty to see that they never happen again but our greater duty is to look to the future the worlds troubles will not go away  the american people want strong and effective international and defense policies in our constitutional system these policies should reflect consultation and accommodation between the president and the congress but in the final analysis as the framers of our constitution knew from hard experience the foreign relations of the united states can be conducted effectively only if there is strong central direction that allows flexibility of action that responsibility clearly rests with the president  i pledge to the american people policies which seek a secure just and peaceful world i pledge to the congress to work with you to that end  we must not face a future in which we can no longer help our friends such as angola even in limited and carefully controlled ways we must not lose all capacity to respond short of military intervention  some hasty actions of the congress during the past yearmost recently in respect to angolawere in my view very shortsighted unfortunately they are still very much on the minds of our allies and our adversaries  a strong defense posture gives weight to our values and our views in international negotiations it assures the vigor of our alliances and it sustains our efforts to promote settlements of international conflicts only from a position of strength can we negotiate a balanced agreement to limit the growth of nuclear arms only a balanced agreement will serve our interests and minimize the threat of nuclear confrontation  the defense budget i will submit to the congress for fiscal year 1977 will show an essential increase over the current year it provides for real growth in purchasing power over this years defense budget which includes the cost of the allvolunteer force  we are continuing to make economies to enhance the efficiency of our military forces but the budget i will submit represents the necessity of american strength for the real world in which we live  as conflict and rivalry persist in the world our united states intelligence capabilities must be the best in the world  the crippling of our foreign intelligence services increases the danger of american involvement in direct armed conflict our adversaries are encouraged to attempt new adventures while our own ability to monitor events and to influence events short of military action is undermined without effective intelligence capability the united states stands blindfolded and hobbled  in the near future i will take actions to reform and strengthen our intelligence community i ask for your positive cooperation it is time to go beyond sensationalism and ensure an effective responsible and responsive intelligence capability  tonight i have spoken about our problems at home and abroad i have recommended policies that will meet the challenge of our third century i have no doubt that our union will endure better stronger and with more individual freedom we can see forward only dimly1 year 5 years a generation perhaps like our forefathers we know that if we meet the challenges of our own time with a common sense of purpose and conviction if we remain true to our constitution and to our ideals then we can know that the future will be better than the past  i see america today crossing a threshold not just because it is our bicentennial but because we have been tested in adversity we have taken a new look at what we want to be and what we want our nation to become  i see america resurgent certain once again that life will be better for our children than it is for us seeking strength that cannot be counted in megatons and riches that cannot be eroded by inflation  i see these united states of america moving forward as before toward a more perfect union where the government serves and the people rule  we will not make this happen simply by making speeches good or bad yours or mine but by hard work and hard decisions made with courage and with common sense  i have heard many inspiring presidential speeches but the words i remember best were spoken by dwight d eisenhower america is not good because it is great the president said america is great because it is good  president eisenhower was raised in a poor but religious home in the heart of america his simple words echoed president lincolns eloquent testament that right makes might and lincoln in turn evoked the silent image of george washington kneeling in prayer at valley forge  so all these magic memories which link eight generations of americans are summed up in the inscription just above me how many times have we seen it in god we trust  let us engrave it now in each of our hearts as we begin our bicentennial  
185, State of the Union Address, Gerald R. Ford,1977-01-12,  mr speaker mr vice president members of the 95th congress and distinguished guests  in accordance with the constitution i come before you once again to report on the state of the union  this report will be my lastmaybelaughterbut for the union it is only the first of such reports in our third century of independence the close of which none of us will ever see we can be confident however that 100 years from now a freely elected president will come before a freely elected congress chosen to renew our great republics pledge to the government of the people by the people and for the people  for my part i pray the third century we are beginning will bring to all americans our children and their childrens children a greater measure of individual equality opportunity and justice a greater abundance of spiritual and material blessings and a higher quality of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  the state of the union is a measurement of the many elements of which it is composeda political union of diverse states an economic union of varying interests an intellectual union of common convictions and a moral union of immutable ideals  taken in sum i can report that the state of the union is good there is room for improvement as always but today we have a more perfect union than when my stewardship began  as a people we discovered that our bicentennial was much more than a celebration of the past it became a joyous reaffirmation of all that it means to be americans a confirmation before all the world of the vitality and durability of our free institutions i am proud to have been privileged to preside over the affairs of our federal government during these eventful years when we proved as i said in my first words upon assuming office that our constitution works our great republic is a government of laws and not of men here the people rule  the people have spoken they have chosen a new president and a new congress to work their will i congratulate youparticularly the new membersas sincerely as i did presidentelect carter in a few days it will be his duty to outline for you his priorities and legislative recommendations tonight i will not infringe on that responsibility but rather wish him the very best in all that is good for our country  during the period of my own service in this capitol and in the white house i can recall many orderly transitions of governmental responsibilityof problems as well as of position of burdens as well as of power the genius of the american system is that we do this so naturally and so normally there are no soldiers marching in the street except in the inaugural parade no public demonstrations except for some of the dancers at the inaugural ball the opposition party doesnt go underground but goes on functioning vigorously in the congress and in the country and our vigilant press goes right on probing and publishing our faults and our follies confirming the wisdom of the framers of the first amendment  because of the transfer of authority in our form of government affects the state of the union and of the world i am happy to report to you that the current transition is proceeding very well i was determined that it should i wanted the new president to get off on an easier start than i had  when i became president on august 9 1974 our nation was deeply divided and tormented in rapid succession the vice president and the president had resigned in disgrace we were still struggling with the aftereffects of a long unpopular and bloody war in southeast asia the economy was unstable and racing toward the worst recession in 40 years people were losing jobs the cost of living was soaring the congress and the chief executive were at loggerheads the integrity of our constitutional process and other institutions was being questioned for more than 15 years domestic spending had soared as federal programs multiplied and the expense escalated annually during the same period our national security needs were steadily shortchanged in the grave situation which prevailed in august 1974 our will to maintain our international leadership was in doubt  i asked for your prayers and went to work  in january 1975 i reported to the congress that the state of the union was not good i proposed urgent action to improve the economy and to achieve energy independence in 10 years i reassured americas allies and sought to reduce the danger of confrontation with potential adversaries i pledged a new direction for america 1975 was a year of difficult decisions but americans responded with realism common sense and selfdiscipline  by january 1976 we were headed in a new direction which i hold to be the right direction for a free society it was guided by the belief that successful problemsolving requires more than federal action alone that it involves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of government and public policies which nurture and promote the creative energies of private enterprises institutions and individual citizens  a year ago i reported that the state of the union was betterin many ways a lot betterbut still not good enough common sense told me to stick to the steady course we were on to continue to restrain the inflationary growth of government to reduce taxes as well as spending to return local decisions to local officials to provide for longrange sufficiency in energy and national security needs i resisted the immense pressures of an election year to open the floodgates of federal money and the temptation to promise more than i could deliver i told it as it was to the american people and demonstrated to the world that in our spirited political competition as in this chamber americans can disagree without being disagreeable  now after 30 months as your president i can say that while we still have a way to go i am proud of the long way we have come together  i am proud of the part i have had in rebuilding confidence in the presidency confidence in our free system and confidence in our future once again americans believe in themselves in their leaders and in the promise that tomorrow holds for their children  i am proud that today america is at peace none of our sons are fighting and dying in battle anywhere in the world and the chance for peace among all nations is improved by our determination to honor our vital commitments in defense of peace and freedom  i am proud that the united states has strong defenses strong alliances and a sound and courageous foreign policy  our alliances with major partners the great industrial democracies of western europe japan and canada have never been more solid consultations on mutual security defense and eastwest relations have grown closer collaboration has branched out into new fields such as energy economic policy and relations with the third world we have used many avenues for cooperation including summit meetings held among major allied countries the friendship of the democracies is deeper warmer and more effective than at any time in 30 years  we are maintaining stability in the strategic nuclear balance and pushing back the specter of nuclear war a decisive step forward was taken in the vladivostok accord which i negotiated with general secretary brezhnevjoint recognition that an equal ceiling should be placed on the number of strategic weapons on each side with resolve and wisdom on the part of both nations a good agreement is well within reach this year  the framework for peace in the middle east has been built hopes for future progress in the middle east were stirred by the historic agreements we reached and the trust and confidence that we formed thanks to american leadership the prospects for peace in the middle east are brighter than they have been in three decades the arab states and israel continue to look to us to lead them from confrontation and war to a new era of accommodation and peace we have no alternative but to persevere and i am sure we will the opportunities for a final settlement are great and the price of failure is a return to the bloodshed and hatred that for too long have brought tragedy to all of the peoples of this area and repeatedly edged the world to the brink of war  our relationship with the peoples republic of china is proving its importance and its durability we are finding more and more common ground between our two countries on basic questions of international affairs  in my two trips to asia as president we have reaffirmed americas continuing vital interest in the peace and security of asia and the pacific basin established a new partnership with japan confirmed our dedication to the security of korea and reinforced our ties with the free nations of southeast asia  an historic dialog has begun between industrial nations and developing nations most proposals on the table are the initiatives of the united states including those on food energy technology trade investment and commodities we are well launched on this process of shaping positive and reliable economic relations between rich nations and poor nations over the long term  we have made progress in trade negotiations and avoided protectionism during recession we strengthened the international monetary system during the past 2 years the free worlds most important economic powers have already brought about important changes that serve both developed and developing economies the momentum already achieved must be nurtured and strengthened for the prosperity of the rich and poor depends upon it  in latin america our relations have taken on a new maturity and a sense of common enterprise  in africa the quest for peace racial justice and economic progress is at a crucial point the united states in close cooperation with the united kingdom is actively engaged in this historic process will change come about by warfare and chaos and foreign intervention or will it come about by negotiated and fair solutions ensuring majority rule minority rights and economic advance america is committed to the side of peace and justice and to the principle that africa should shape its own future free of outside intervention  american leadership has helped to stimulate new international efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to shape a comprehensive treaty governing the use of oceans  i am gratified by these accomplishments they constitute a record of broad success for america and for the peace and prosperity of all mankind this administration leaves to its successor a world in better condition than we found we leave as well a solid foundation for progress on a range of issues that are vital to the wellbeing of america  what has been achieved in the field of foreign affairs and what can be accomplished by the new administration demonstrate the genius of americans working together for the common good it is this our remarkable ability to work together that has made us a unique nation it is congress the president and the people striving for a better world  i know all patriotic americans want this nations foreign policy to succeed i urge members of my party in this congress to give the new president loyal support in this area i express the hope that this new congress will reexamine its constitutional role in international affairs  the exclusive right to declare war the duty to advise and consent on the part of the senate the power of the purse on the part of the house are ample authority for the legislative branch and should be jealously guarded but because we may have been too careless of these powers in the past does not justify congressional intrusion into or obstruction of the proper exercise of presidential responsibilities now or in the future there can be only one commander in chief in these times crises cannot be managed and wars cannot be waged by committee nor can peace be pursued solely by parliamentary debate to the ears of the world the president speaks for the nation while he is of course ultimately accountable to the congress the courts and the people he and his emissaries must not be handicapped in advance in their relations with foreign governments as has sometimes happened in the past  at home i am encouraged by the nations recovery from the recession and our steady return to sound economic growth it is now continuing after the recent period of uncertainty which is part of the price we pay for free elections  our most pressing need today and the future is more jobsproductive permanent jobs created by a thriving economy we must revise our tax system both to ease the burden of heavy taxation and to encourage the investment necessary for the creation of productive jobs for all americans who want to work  earlier this month i proposed a permanent income tax reduction of 10 billion below current levels including raising the personal exemption from 750 to 1000 i also recommended a series of measures to stimulate investment such as accelerated depreciation for new plants and equipment in areas of high unemployment a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 48 to 46 percent and eliminating the present double taxation of dividends i strongly urge the congress to pass these measures to help create the productive permanent jobs in the private economy that are so essential for our future  all the basic trends are good we are not on the brink of another recession or economic disaster if we follow prudent policies that encourage productive investment and discourage destructive inflation we will come out on top and i am sure we will  we have successfully cut inflation by more than half when i took office the consumer price index was rising at 122 percent a year during 1976 the rate of inflation was 5 percent  we have created more jobsover 4 million more jobs today than in the spring of 1975 throughout this nation today we have over 88 million people in useful productive jobsmore than at any other time in our nations history but there are still too many americans unemployed this is the greatest regret that i have as i leave office  we brought about with the congress after much delay the renewal of the general revenue sharing we expanded community development and federal manpower programs we began a significant urban mass transit program federal programs today provide more funds for our states and local governments than ever before70 billion for the current fiscal year through these programs and others that provide aid directly to individuals we have kept faith with our tradition of compassionate help for those who need it as we begin our third century we can be proud of the progress that we have made in meeting human needs for all of our citizens  we have cut the growth of crime by nearly 90 percent two years ago crime was increasing at the rate of 18 percent annually in the first three quarters of 1976 that growth rate had been cut to 2 percent but crime and the fear of crime remains one of the most serious problems facing our citizens  we have had some successes and there have been some disappointments bluntly i must remind you that we have not made satisfactory progress toward achieving energy independence energy is absolutely vital to the defense of our country to the strength of our economy and to the quality of our lives  two years ago i proposed to the congress the first comprehensive national energy programa specific and coordinated set of measures that would end our vulnerability to embargo blockade or arbitrary price increases and would mobilize us technology and resources to supply a significant share of the free worlds energy after 1985 of the major energy proposals i submitted 2 years ago only half belatedly became law in 1973 we were dependent upon foreign oil imports for 36 percent of our needs today we are 40percent dependent and well pay out 34 billion for foreign oil this year such vulnerability at present or in the future is intolerable and must be ended  the answer to where we stand on our national energy effort today reminds me of the old argument about whether the tank is half full or half empty the pessimist will say we have half failed to achieve our 10year energy goals the optimist will say that we have half succeeded i am always an optimist but we must make up for lost time  we have laid a solid foundation for completing the enormous task which confronts us i have signed into law five major energy bills which contain significant measures for conservation resource development stockpiling and standby authorities we have moved forward to develop the naval petroleum reserves to build a 500million barrel strategic petroleum stockpile to phase out unnecessary government allocation and price controls to develop a lasting relationship with other oil consuming nations to improve the efficiency of energy use through conservation in automobiles buildings and industry and to expand research on new technology and renewable resources such as wind power geothermal and solar energy all these actions significant as they are for the long term are only the beginning  i recently submitted to the congress my proposals to reorganize the federal energy structure and the hard choices which remain if we are serious about reducing our dependence upon foreign energy these include programs to reverse our declining production of natural gas and increase incentives for domestic crude oil production i proposed to minimize environmental uncertainties affecting coal development expand nuclear power generation and create an energy independence authority to provide government financial assistance for vital energy programs where private capital is not available  we must explore every reasonable prospect for meeting our energy needs when our current domestic reserves of oil and natural gas begin to dwindle in the next decade i urgently ask congress and the new administration to move quickly on these issues this nation has the resources and the capability to achieve our energy goals if its government has the will to proceed and i think we do  i have been disappointed by inability to complete many of the meaningful organizational reforms which i contemplated for the federal government although a start has been made for example the federal judicial system has long served as a model for other courts but today it is threatened by a shortage of qualified federal judges and an explosion of litigation claiming federal jurisdiction i commend to the new administration and the congress the recent report and recommendations of the department of justice undertaken at my request on the needs of the federal courts i especially endorse its proposals for a new commission on the judicial appointment process  while the judicial branch of our government may require reinforcement the budgets and payrolls of the other branches remain staggering i cannot help but observe that while the white house staff and the executive office of the president have been reduced and the total number of civilians in the executive branch contained during the 1970s the legislative branch has increased substantially although the membership of the congress remains at 535 congress now costs the taxpayers more than a million dollars per member the whole legislative budget has passed the billion dollar mark  we have made some progress in cutting back the expansion of government and its intrusion into individual lives but believe me there is much more to be doneand you and i know it it can only be done by tough and temporarily painful surgery by a congress as prepared as the president to face up to this very real political problem again i wish my successor working with a substantial majority of his own party the best of success in reforming the costly and cumbersome machinery of the federal government  the task of selfgovernment is never finished the problems are great the opportunities are greater  americas first goal is and always will be peace with honor america must remain first in keeping peace in the world we can remain first in peace only if we are never second in defense  in presenting the state of the union to the congress and to the american people i have a special obligation as commander in chief to report on our national defense our survival as a free and independent people requires above all strong military forces that are well equipped and highly trained to perform their assigned mission  i am particularly gratified to report that over the past 2 12 years we have been able to reverse the dangerous decline of the previous decade in real resources this country was devoting to national defense this was an immediate problem i faced in 1974 the evidence was unmistakable that the soviet union had been steadily increasing the resources it applied to building its military strength during this same period the united states real defense spending declined in my three budgets we not only arrested that dangerous decline but we have established the positive trend which is essential to our ability to contribute to peace and stability in the world  the vietnam war both materially and psychologically affected our overall defense posture the dangerous antimilitary sentiment discouraged defense spending and unfairly disparaged the men and women who serve in our armed forces  the challenge that now confronts this country is whether we have the national will and determination to continue this essential defense effort over the long term as it must be continued we can no longer afford to oscillate from year to year in so vital a matter indeed we have a duty to look beyond the immediate question of budgets and to examine the nature of the problem we will face over the next generation  i am the first recent president able to address longterm basic issues without the burden of vietnam the war in indochina consumed enormous resources at the very time that the overwhelming strategic superiority we once enjoyed was disappearing in past years as a result of decisions by the united states our strategic forces leveled off yet the soviet union continued a steady constant buildup of its own forces committing a high percentage of its national economic effort to defense  the united states can never tolerate a shift in strategic balance against us or even a situation where the american people or our allies believe the balance is shifting against us the united states would risk the most serious political consequences if the world came to believe that our adversaries have a decisive margin of superiority  to maintain a strategic balance we must look ahead to the 1980s and beyond the sophistication of modern weapons requires that we make decisions now if we are to ensure our security 10 years from now therefore i have consistently advocated and strongly urged that we pursue three critical strategic programs the trident missile launching submarine the b1 bomber with its superior capability to penetrate modern air defenses and a more advanced intercontinental ballistic missile that will be better able to survive nuclear attack and deliver a devastating retaliatory strike  in an era where the strategic nuclear forces are in rough equilibrium the risks of conflict below the nuclear threshold may grow more perilous a major longterm objective therefore is to maintain capabilities to deal with and thereby deter conventional challenges and crises particularly in europe  we cannot rely solely on strategic forces to guarantee our security or to deter all types of aggression we must have superior naval and marine forces to maintain freedom of the seas strong multipurpose tactical air forces and mobile modern ground forces accordingly i have directed a longterm effort to improve our worldwide capabilities to deal with regional crises  i have submitted a 5year naval building program indispensable to the nations maritime strategy because the security of europe and the integrity of nato remain the cornerstone of american defense policy i have initiated a special longterm program to ensure the capacity of the alliance to deter or defeat aggression in europe  as i leave office i can report that our national defense is effectively deterring conflict today our armed forces are capable of carrying out the variety of missions assigned to them programs are underway which will assure we can deter war in the years ahead but i also must warn that it will require a sustained effort over a period of years to maintain these capabilities we must have the wisdom the stamina and the courage to prepare today for the perils of tomorrow and i believe we will  as i look to the futureand i assure you i intend to go on doing that for a good many yearsi can say with confidence that the state of the union is good but we must go on making it better and better  this gathering symbolizes the constitutional foundation which makes continued progress possible synchronizing the skills of three independent branches of government reserving fundamental sovereignty to the people of this great land it is only as the temporary representatives and servants of the people that we meet here we bring no hereditary status or gift of infallibility and none follows us from this place  like president washington like the more fortunate of his successors i look forward to the status of private citizen with gladness and gratitude to me being a citizen of the united states of america is the greatest honor and privilege in this world  from the opportunities which fate and my fellow citizens have given me as a member of the house as vice president and president of the senate and as president of all the people i have come to understand and place the highest value on the checks and balances which our founders imposed on government through the separation of powers among coequal legislative executive and judicial branches this often results in difficulty and delay as i well know but it also places supreme authority under god beyond any one person any one branch any majority great or small or any one party the constitution is the bedrock of all our freedoms guard and cherish it keep honor and order in your own house and the republic will endure  it is not easy to end these remarks in this chamber along with some of you i have experienced many many of the highlights of my life it was here that i stood 28 years ago with my freshman colleagues as speaker sam rayburn administered the oath i see some of you nowcharlie bennett dick bolling carl perkins pete rodino harley staggers tom steed sid yates clem zablockiand i remember those who have gone to their rest it was here we waged many many a lively battlewon some lost some but always remaining friends it was here surrounded by such friends that the distinguished chief justice swore me in as vice president on december 6 1973 it was here i returned 8 months later as your president to ask not for a honeymoon but for a good marriage  i will always treasure those memories and your many many kindnesses i thank you for them all  my fellow americans i once asked you for your prayers and now i give you mine may god guide this wonderful country its people and those they have chosen to lead them may our third century be illuminated by liberty and blessed with brotherhood so that we and all who come after us may be the humble servants of thy peace amen  good night god bless you  
186, State of the Union Address, Jimmy Carter,1978-01-19,  two years ago today we had the first caucus in iowa and one year ago tomorrow i walked from here to the white house to take up the duties of president of the united states i didnt know it then when i walked but ive been trying to save energy ever since  i return tonight to fulfill one of those duties of the constitution to give to the congress and to the nation information on the state of the union  militarily politically economically and in spirit the state of our union is sound  we are a great country a strong country a vital and dynamic country and so we will remain  we are a confident people and a hardworking people a decent and a compassionate people and so we will remain  i want to speak to you tonight about where we are and where we must go about what we have done and what we must do and i want to pledge to you my best efforts and ask you to pledge yours  each generation of americans has to face circumstances not of its own choosing but by which its character is measured and its spirit is tested  there are times of emergency when a nation and its leaders must bring their energies to bear on a single urgent task that was the duty abraham lincoln faced when our land was torn apart by conflict in the war between the states that was the duty faced by franklin roosevelt when he led america out of an economic depression and again when he led america to victory in war  there are other times when there is no single overwhelming crisis yet profound national interests are at stake  at such times the risk of inaction can be equally great it becomes the task of leaders to call forth the vast and restless energies of our people to build for the future  that is what harry truman did in the years after the second world war when we helped europe and japan rebuild themselves and secured an international order that has protected freedom from aggression  we live in such times now and we face such duties  weve come through a long period of turmoil and doubt but weve once again found our moral course and with a new spirit we are striving to express our best instincts to the rest of the world  there is all across our land a growing sense of peace and a sense of common purpose this sense of unity cannot be expressed in programs or in legislation or in dollars its an achievement that belongs to every individual american this unity ties together and it towers over all our efforts here in washington and it serves as an inspiring beacon for all of us who are elected to serve  this new atmosphere demands a new spirit a partnership between those of us who lead and those who elect the foundations of this partnership are truth the courage to face hard decisions concern for one another and the common good over special interests and a basic faith and trust in the wisdom and strength and judgment of the american people  for the first time in a generation we are not haunted by a major international crisis or by domestic turmoil and we now have a rare and a priceless opportunity to address persistent problems and burdens which come to us as a nation quietly and steadily getting worse over the years  as president ive had to ask you the members of congress and you the american people to come to grips with some of the most difficult and hard questions facing our society  we must make a maximum effort because if we do not aim for the best we are very likely to achieve little i see no benefit to the country if we delay because the problems will only get worse  we need patience and good will but we really need to realize that there is a limit to the role and the function of government government cannot solve our problems it cant set our goals it cannot define our vision government cannot eliminate poverty or provide a bountiful economy or reduce inflation or save our cities or cure illiteracy or provide energy and government cannot mandate goodness only a true partnership between government and the people can ever hope to reach these goals  those of us who govern can sometimes inspire and we can identify needs and marshal resources but we simply cannot be the managers of everything and everybody  we here in washington must move away from crisis management and we must establish clear goals for the future immediate and the distant future which will let us work together and not in conflict never again should we neglect a growing crisis like the shortage of energy where further delay will only lead to more harsh and painful solutions  every day we spend more than 120 million for foreign oil this slows our economic growth it lowers the value of the dollar overseas and it aggravates unemployment and inflation here at home  now we know what we must do increase production we must cut down on waste and we must use more of those fuels which are plentiful and more permanent we must be fair to people and we must not disrupt our nations economy and our budget  now that sounds simple but i recognize the difficulties involved i know that it is not easy for the congress to act but the fact remains that on the energy legislation we have failed the american people almost 5 years after the oil embargo dramatized the problem for us all we still do not have a national energy program not much longer can we tolerate this stalemate it undermines our national interest both at home and abroad we must succeed and i believe we will  our main task at home this year with energy a central element is the nations economy we must continue the recovery and further cut unemployment and inflation  last year was a good one for the united states we reached all of our major economic goals for 1977 four million new jobs were created an alltime record and the number of unemployed dropped by more than a million unemployment right now is the lowest it has been since 1974 and not since world war ii has such a high percentage of american people been employed  the rate of inflation went down there was a good growth in business profits and investments the source of more jobs for our workers and a higher standard of living for all our people after taxes and inflation there was a healthy increase in workers wages  and this year our country will have the first 2 trillion economy in the history of the world  now we are proud of this progress the first year but we must do even better in the future  we still have serious problems on which all of us must work together our trade deficit is too large inflation is still too high and too many americans still do not have a job  now i didnt have any simple answers for all these problems but we have developed an economic policy that is working because its simple balanced and fair its based on four principles first the economy must keep on expanding to produce new jobs and better income which our people need the fruits of growth must be widely shared more jobs must be made available to those who have been bypassed until now and the tax system must be made fairer and simpler  secondly private business and not the government must lead the expansion in the future  third we must lower the rate of inflation and keep it down inflation slows down economic growth and its the most cruel to the poor and also to the elderly and others who live on fixed incomes  and fourth we must contribute to the strength of the world economy  i will announce detailed proposals for improving our tax system later this week we can make our tax laws fairer we can make them simpler and easier to understand and at the same time we can and we will reduce the tax burden on american citizens by 25 billion  the tax reforms and the tax reductions go together only with the long overdue reforms will the full tax cut be advisable  almost 17 billion in income tax cuts will go to individuals ninetysix percent of all american taxpayers will see their taxes go down for a typical family of four this means an annual saving of more than 250 a year or a tax reduction of about 20 percent a further 2 billion cut in excise taxes will give more relief and also contribute directly to lowering the rate of inflation  and we will also provide strong additional incentives for business investment and growth through substantial cuts in the corporate tax rates and improvement in the investment tax credit  now these tax proposals will increase opportunity everywhere in the nation but additional jobs for the disadvantaged deserve special attention  weve already passed laws to assure equal access to the voting booth and to restaurants and to schools to housing and laws to permit access to jobs but job opportunity the chance to earn a decent living is also a basic human right which we cannot and will not ignore  a major priority for our nation is the final elimination of the barriers that restrict the opportunities available to women and also to black people and hispanics and other minorities weve come a long way toward that goal but there is still much to do what we inherited from the past must not be permitted to shackle us in the future  ill be asking you for a substantial increase in funds for public jobs for our young people and i also am recommending that the congress continue the public service employment programs at more than twice the level of a year ago when welfare reform is completed we will have more than a million additional jobs so that those on welfare who are able to work can work  however again we know that in our free society private business is still the best source of new jobs therefore i will propose a new program to encourage businesses to hire young and disadvantaged americans these young people only need skills and a chance in order to take their place in our economic system lets give them the chance they need a major step in the right direction would be the early passage of a greatly improved humphreyhawkins bill  my budget for 1979 addresses these national needs but it is lean and tight i have cut waste wherever possible  i am proposing an increase of less than 2 percent after adjusting for inflation the smallest increase in the federal budget in 4 years  lately federal spending has taken a steadily increasing portion of what americans produce our new budget reverses that trend and later i hope to bring the governments toll down even further and with your help well do that  in time of high employment and a strong economy deficit spending should not be a feature of our budget as the economy continues to gain strength and as our unemployment rates continue to fall revenues will grow with careful planning efficient management and proper restraint on spending we can move rapidly toward a balanced budget and we will  next year the budget deficit will be only slightly less than this year but onethird of the deficit is due to the necessary tax cuts that ive proposed this year the right choice is to reduce the burden on taxpayers and provide more jobs for our people  the third element in our program is a renewed attack on inflation weve learned the hard way that high unemployment will not prevent or cure inflation government can help us by stimulating private investment and by maintaining a responsible economic policy through a new toplevel review process we will do a better job of reducing government regulation that drives up costs and drives up prices  but again government alone cannot bring down the rate of inflation when a level of high inflation is expected to continue then companies raise prices to protect their profit margins against prospective increases in wages and other costs while workers demand higher wages as protection against expected price increases its like an escalation in the arms race and understandably no one wants to disarm alone  now no one firm or a group of workers can halt this process its an effort that we must all make together im therefore asking government business labor and other groups to join in a voluntary program to moderate inflation by holding wage and price increases in each sector of the economy during 1978 below the average increases of the last 2 years  i do not believe in wage and price controls a sincere commitment to voluntary constraint provides a way perhaps the only way to fight inflation without government interference  as i came into the capitol tonight i saw the farmers my fellow farmers standing out in the snow im familiar with their problem and i know from congress action that you are too when i was running carters warehouse we had spread on our own farms 51015 fertilizer for about 40 a ton the last time i was home the price was about 100 a ton the cost of nitrogen has gone up 150 percent and the price of products that farmers sell has either stayed the same or gone down a little  now this past year in 1977 you the congress and i together passed a new agricultural act it went into effect october 1 itll have its first impact on the 1978 crops it will help a great deal itll add 6 12 billion or more to help the farmers with their price supports and target prices  last year we had the highest level of exports of farm products in the history of our country 24 billion we expect to have more this year well be working together but i think its incumbent on us to monitor very carefully the farm situation and continue to work harmoniously with the farmers of our country whats best for the farmers the farm families in the long run is also best for the consumers of our country  economic success at home is also the key to success in our international economic policy an effective energy program strong investment and productivity and controlled inflation will provide improve our trade balance and balance it and it will help to protect the integrity of the dollar overseas  by working closely with our friends abroad we can promote the economic health of the whole world with fair and balanced agreements lowering the barriers to trade  despite the inevitable pressures that build up when the world economy suffers from high unemployment we must firmly resist the demands for selfdefeating protectionism but free trade must also be fair trade and i am determined to protect american industry and american workers against foreign trade practices which are unfair or illegal  in a separate written message to congress ive outlined other domestic initiatives such as welfare reform consumer protection basic education skills urban policy reform of our labor laws and national health care later on this year i will not repeat these tonight but there are several other points that i would like to make directly to you  during these past years americans have seen our government grow far from us  for some citizens the government has almost become like a foreign country so strange and distant that weve often had to deal with it through trained ambassadors who have sometimes become too powerful and too influential lawyers accountants and lobbyists this cannot go on  we must have what abraham lincoln wanted a government for the people  weve made progress toward that kind of government youve given me the authority i requested to reorganize the federal bureaucracy and i am using that authority  weve already begun a series of reorganization plans which will be completed over a period of 3 years we have also proposed abolishing almost 500 federal advisory and other commissions and boards but i know that the american people are still sick and tired of federal paperwork and redtape bit by bit we are chopping down the thicket of unnecessary federal regulations by which government too often interferes in our personal lives and our personal business weve cut the publics federal paperwork load by more than 12 percent in less than a year and we are not through cutting  weve made a good start on turning the gobbledygook of federal regulations into plain english that people can understand but we know that we still have a long way to go  weve brought together parts of 11 government agencies to create a new department of energy and now its time to take another major step by creating a separate department of education  but even the best organized government will only be as effective as the people who carry out its policies for this reason i consider civil service reform to be absolutely vital worked out with the civil servants themselves this reorganization plan will restore the merit principle to a system which has grown into a bureaucratic maze it will provide greater management flexibility and better rewards for better performance without compromising job security  then and only then can we have a government that is efficient open and truly worthy of our peoples understanding and respect i have promised that we will have such a government and i intend to keep that promise  in our foreign policy the separation of people from government has been in the past a source of weakness and error in a democratic system like ours foreign policy decisions must be able to stand the test of public examination and public debate if we make a mistake in this administration it will be on the side of frankness and openness with the american people  in our modern world when the deaths of literally millions of people can result from a few terrifying seconds of destruction the path of national strength and security is identical to the path of peace  tonight i am happy to report that because we are strong our nation is at peace with the world  we are a confident nation weve restored a moral basis for our foreign policy the very heart of our identity as a nation is our firm commitment to human rights  we stand for human rights because we believe that government has as a purpose to promote the wellbeing of its citizens this is true in our domestic policy its also true in our foreign policy the world must know that in support of human rights the united states will stand firm  we expect no quick or easy results but there has been significant movement toward greater freedom and humanity in several parts of the world  thousands of political prisoners have been freed the leaders of the world even our ideological adversaries now see that their attitude toward fundamental human rights affects their standing in the international community and it affects their relations with the united states  to serve the interests of every american our foreign policy has three major goals  the first and prime concern is and will remain the security of our country  security is based on our national will and security is based on the strength of our armed forces we have the will and militarily we are very strong  security also comes through the strength of our alliances we have reconfirmed our commitment to the defense of europe and this year we will demonstrate that commitment by further modernizing and strengthening our military capabilities there  security can also be enhanced by agreements with potential adversaries which reduce the threat of nuclear disaster while maintaining our own relative strategic capability  in areas of peaceful competition with the soviet union we will continue to more than hold our own  at the same time we are negotiating with quiet confidence without haste with careful determination to ease the tensions between us and to ensure greater stability and security  the strategic arms limitation talks have been long and difficult we want a mutual limit on both the quality and the quantity of the giant nuclear arsenals of both nations and then we want actual reductions in strategic arms as a major step toward the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth  if these talks result in an agreement this year and i trust they will i pledge to you that the agreement will maintain and enhance the stability of the worlds strategic balance and the security of the united states  for 30 years concerted but unsuccessful efforts have been made to ban the testing of atomic explosives both military weapons and peaceful nuclear devices  we are hard at work with great britain and the soviet union on an agreement which will stop testing and will protect our national security and provide for adequate verification of compliance we are now making i believe good progress toward this comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions  we are also working vigorously to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which do not now have them and to reduce the deadly global traffic in conventional arms sales our stand for peace is suspect if we are also the principal arms merchant of the world so weve decided to cut down our arms transfers abroad on a yearbyyear basis and to work with other major arms exporters to encourage their similar constraint  every american has a stake in our second major goal a world at peace in a nuclear age each of us is threatened when peace is not secured everywhere we are trying to promote harmony in those parts of the world where major differences exist among other nations and threaten international peace  in the middle east we are contributing our good offices to maintain the momentum of the current negotiations and to keep open the lines of communication among the middle eastern leaders the whole world has a great stake in the success of these efforts this is a precious opportunity for a historic settlement of a longstanding conflict an opportunity which may never come again in our lifetime  our role has been difficult and sometimes thankless and controversial but it has been constructive and it has been necessary and it will continue  our third major foreign policy goal is one that touches the life of every american citizen every day world economic growth and stability  this requires strong economic performance by the industrialized democracies like ourselves and progress in resolving the global energy crisis last fall with the help of others we succeeded in our vigorous efforts to maintain the stability of the price of oil but as many foreign leaders have emphasized to me personally and i am sure to you the greatest future contribution that america can make to the world economy would be an effective energy conservation program here at home we will not hesitate to take the actions needed to protect the integrity of the american dollar  we are trying to develop a more just international system and in this spirit we are supporting the struggle for human development in africa in asia and in latin america  finally the world is watching to see how we act on one of our most important and controversial items of business approval of the panama canal treaties the treaties now before the senate are the result of the work of four administrations two democratic two republican  they guarantee that the canal will be open always for unrestricted use by the ships of the world our ships have the right to go to the head of the line for priority of passage in times of emergency or need we retain the permanent right to defend the canal with our own military forces if necessary to guarantee its openness and its neutrality  the treaties are to the clear advantage of ourselves the panamanians and the other users of the canal ratifying the panama canal treaties will demonstrate our good faith to the world discourage the spread of hostile ideologies in this hemisphere and directly contribute to the economic wellbeing and the security of the united states  i have to say that thats very welcome applause  there were two moments on my recent journey which for me confirmed the final aims of our foreign policy and what it always must be  one was in a little village in india where i met a people as passionately attached to their rights and liberties as we are but whose children have a far smaller chance for good health or food or education or human fulfillment than a child born in this country  the other moment was in warsaw capital of a nation twice devastated by war in this century there people have rebuilt the city which wars destruction took from them but what was new only emphasized clearly what was lost  what i saw in those two places crystalized for me the purposes of our own nations policy to ensure economic justice to advance human rights to resolve conflicts without violence and to proclaim in our great democracy our constant faith in the liberty and dignity of human beings everywhere  we americans have a great deal of work to do together in the end how well we do that work will depend on the spirit in which we approach it we must seek fresh answers unhindered by the stale prescriptions of the past  it has been said that our best years are behind us but i say again that americas best is still ahead we have emerged from bitter experiences chastened but proud confident once again ready to face challenges once again and united once again  we come together tonight at a solemn time last week the senate lost a good and honest man lee metcalf of montana  and today the flag of the united states flew at halfmast from this capitol and from american installations and ships all over the world in mourning for senator hubert humphrey  because he exemplified so well the joy and the zest of living his death reminds us not so much of our own mortality but of the possibilities offered to us by life he always looked to the future with a special american kind of confidence of hope and enthusiasm and the best way that we can honor him is by following his example  our task to use the words of senator humphrey is reconciliation rebuilding and rebirth  reconciliation of private needs and interests into a higher purpose  rebuilding the old dreams of justice and liberty and country and community  rebirth of our faith in the common good  each of us here tonight and all who are listening in your homes must rededicate ourselves to serving the common good we are a community a beloved community all of us our individual fates are linked our futures intertwined and if we act in that knowledge and in that spirit together as the bible says we can move mountains  thank you very much  
187, State of the Union Address, Jimmy Carter,1979-01-25,  tonight i want to examine in a broad sense the state of our american unionhow we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous world  our children who will be born this year will come of age in the 21st century what kind of society what kind of world are we building for them will we ourselves be at peace will our children enjoy a better quality of life will a strong and united america still be a force for freedom and prosperity around the world  tonight there is every sign that the state of our union is sound  our economy offers greater prosperity for more of our people than ever before real per capita income and real business profits have risen substantially in the last 2 years farm exports are setting an alltime record each year and farm income last year net farm income was up more than 25 percent  our liberties are secure our military defenses are strong and growing stronger and more importantly tonight americaour beloved countryis at peace  our earliest national commitments modified and reshaped by succeeding generations have served us well but the problems that we face today are different from those that confronted earlier generations of americans they are more subtle more complex and more interrelated at home we are recognizing ever more clearly that government alone cannot solve these problems and abroad few of them can be solved by the united states alone but americans as a united people working with our allies and friends have never been afraid to face problems and to solve problems either here or abroad  the challenge to us is to build a new and firmer foundation for the futurefor a sound economy for a more effective government for more political trust and for a stable peaceso that the america our children inherit will be even stronger and even better than it is today  we cannot resort to simplistic or extreme solutions which substitute myths for common sense  in our economy it is a myth that we must choose endlessly between inflation and recession together we build the foundation for a strong economy with lower inflation without contriving either a recession with its high unemployment or unworkable mandatory government controls  in our government it is a myth that we must choose between compassion and competence together we build the foundation for a government that works and works for people  in our relations with our potential adversaries it is a myth that we must choose between confrontation and capitulation together we build the foundation for a stable world of both diversity and peace  together weve already begun to build the foundation for confidence in our economic system during the last 2 years in bringing our economy out of the deepest recession since the 1930s weve created 7100000 new jobs the unemployment rate has gone down 25 percent and now we must redouble our fight against the persistent inflation that has wracked our country for more than a decade thats our important domestic issue and we must do it together  we know that inflation is a burden for all americans but its a disaster for the poor the sick and the old no american family should be forced to choose among food warmth health care or decent housing because the cost of any of these basic necessities has climbed out of reach  three months ago i outlined to the nation a balanced antiinflation program that couples responsible government restraint with responsible wage and price restraint its based upon my knowledge that there is a more powerful force than government compulsionthe force created by the cooperative efforts of millions of americans working toward a common goal  business and labor have been increasingly supportive its imperative that we in government do our part we must stop excessive government growth and we must control government spending habits  ive sent to this congress a stringent but a fair budget one that since i ran for president in 1976 will have cut the federal deficit in half and as a percentage of our gross national product the deficit will have dropped by almost 75 percent  this congress had a good record last year and i now ask the 96th congress to continue this partnership in holding the line on excess federal spending it will not be easy but we must be strong and we must be persistent  this budget is a clear message that with the help of you and the american people i am determined as president to bring inflation under control  the 1980 budget provides enough spending restraint to begin unwinding inflation but enough support for our country to keep american workers productive and to encourage the investments that provide new jobs we will continue to mobilize our nations resources to reduce our trade deficit substantially this year and to maintain the strength of the american dollar  weve demonstrated in this restrained budget that we can build on the gains of the past 2 years to provide additional support to educate disadvantaged children to care for the elderly to provide nutrition and legal services for the poor and to strengthen the economic base of our urban communities and also our rural areas  this year we will take our first steps to develop a national health plan  we must never accept a permanent group of unemployed americans with no hope and no stake in building our society for those left out of the economy because of discrimination a lack of skills or poverty we must maintain high levels of training and we must continue to provide jobs  a responsible budget is not our only weapon to control inflation we must act now to protect all americans from health care costs that are rising 1 million per hour 24 hours a day doubling every 5 years we must take control of the largest contributor to that inflation skyrocketing hospital costs  there will be no clearer test of the commitment of this congress to the antiinflation fight than the legislation that i will submit again this year to hold down inflation in hospital care  over the next 5 years my proposals will save americans a total of 60 billion of which 25 billion will be savings to the american taxpayer in the federal budget itself the american people have waited long enough this year we must act on hospital cost containment  we must also fight inflation by improvements and better enforcement of our antitrust laws and by reducing government obstacles to competition in the private sector  we must begin to scrutinize the overall effect of regulation in our economy through deregulation of the airline industry weve increased profits cut prices for all americans and begunfor one of the few times in the history of our nationto actually dismantle a major federal bureaucracy this year we must begin the effort to reform our regulatory processes for the railroad bus and the trucking industries  america has the greatest economic system in the world lets reduce government interference and give it a chance to work  i call on congress to take other antiinflation actionto expand our exports to protect american jobs threatened by unfair trade to conserve energy to increase production and to speed development of solar power and to reassess our nations technological superiority american workers who enlist in the fight against inflation deserve not just our gratitude but they deserve the protection of the real wage insurance proposal that i have already made to the congress  to be successful we must change our attitudes as well as our policies we cannot afford to live beyond our means we cannot afford to create programs that we can neither manage nor finance or to waste our natural resources and we cannot tolerate mismanagement and fraud above all we must meet the challenges of inflation as a united people  with the support of the american people government in recent decades has helped to dismantle racial barriers has provided assistance for the jobless and the retired has fed the hungry has protected the safety health and bargaining rights of american workers and has helped to preserve our natural heritage  but its not enough to have created a lot of government programs now we must make the good programs more effective and improve or weed out those which are wasteful or unnecessary  with the support of the congress weve begun to reorganize and to get control of the bureaucracy we are reforming the civil service system so that we can recognize and reward those who do a good job and correct or remove those who do not  this year we must extend major reorganization efforts to education to economic development and to the management of our natural resources we need to enact a sunshine sunset law that when government programs have outlived their value they will automatically be terminated  theres no such thing as an effective and a noncontroversial reorganization and reform but we know that honest effective government is essential to restore public faith in our public action  none of us can be satisfied when twothirds of the american citizens chose not to vote last year in a national election too many americans feel powerless against the influence of private lobbying groups and the unbelievable flood of private campaign money which threatens our electoral process  this year we must regain the publics faith by requiring limited financial funds from public funds for congressional election campaigns house bill 1 provides for this public financing of campaigns and i look forward with a great deal of anticipation to signing it at an early date  a strong economy and an effective government will restore confidence in america but the path of the future must be charted in peace we must continue to build a new and a firm foundation for a stable world community  we are building that new foundation from a position of national strengththe strength of our own defenses the strength of our friendships with other nations and of our oldest american ideals  americas military power is a major force for security and stability in the world we must maintain our strategic capability and continue the progress of the last 2 years with our nato allies with whom we have increased our readiness modernized our equipment and strengthened our defense forces in europe i urge you to support the strong defense budget which i have proposed to the congress  but our national security in this complicated age requires more than just military might in less than a lifetime world population has more than doubled colonial empires have disappeared and a hundred new nations have been born and migration to the worlds cities have all awakened new yearnings for economic justice and human rights among people everywhere  this demand for justice and human rights is a wave of the future in such a world the choice is not which super power will dominate the world none can and none will the choice instead is between a world of anarchy and destruction or a world of cooperation and peace  in such a world we seek not to stifle inevitable change but to influence its course in helpful and constructive ways that enhance our values our national interests and the cause of peace  towering over this volatile changing world like a thundercloud on a summer day looms the awesome power of nuclear weapons  we will continue to help shape the forces of change to anticipate emerging problems of nuclear proliferation and conventional arms sales and to use our great strength parts of the world before they erupt and spread  we have no desire to be the worlds policeman but america does want to be the worlds peacemaker  we are building the foundation for truly global cooperation not only with western and industrialized nations but with the developing countries as well our ties with japan and our european allies are stronger than ever and so are our friendly relations with the people of latin america africa and the western pacific and asia  weve won new respect in this hemisphere with the panama canal treaties weve gained new trust with the developing world through our opposition to racism our commitment to human rights and our support for majority rule in africa  the multilateral trade negotiations are now reaching a successful conclusion and congressional approval is essential to the economic wellbeing of our own country and of the world this will be one of our top priorities in 1979  we are entering a hopeful era in our relations with onefourth of the worlds people who live in china the presence of vice premier deng xiaoping next week will help to inaugurate that new era and with prompt congressional action on authorizing legislation we will continue our commitment to a prosperous peaceful and secure life for the people of taiwan  im grateful that in the past year as in the year before no american has died in combat anywhere in the world and in iran nicaragua cyprus namibia and rhodesia our country is working for peaceful solutions to dangerous conflicts  in the middle east under the most difficult circumstances we have sought to help ancient enemies lay aside deepseated differences that have produced four bitter wars in our lifetime  our firm commitment to israels survival and security is rooted in our deepest convictions and in our knowledge of the strategic importance to our own nation of a stable middle east to promote peace and reconciliation in the region we must retain the trust and the confidence both of israel and also of the arab nations that are sincerely searching for peace  i am determined as president to use the full beneficial influence of our country so that the precious opportunity for lasting peace between israel and egypt will not be lost  the new foundation of international cooperation that we seek excludes no nation cooperation with the soviet union serves the cause of peace for in this nuclear age world peace must include peace between the super powersand it must mean the control of nuclear arms  ten years ago the united states and the soviet union made the historic decision to open the strategic arms limitations talks or salt the purpose of salt then as now is not to gain a unilateral advantage for either nation but to protect the security of both nations to reverse the costly and dangerous momentum of the nuclear arms race to preserve a stable balance of nuclear forces and to demonstrate to a concerned world that we are determined to help preserve the peace  the first salt agreement was concluded in 1972 and since then during 6 years of negotiation by both republican and democratic leaders nearly all issues of salt ii have been resolved if the soviet union continues to negotiate in good faith a responsible salt agreement will be reached  its important that the american people understand the nature of the salt process  salt ii is not based on sentiment its based on selfinterestof the united states and of the soviet union both nations share a powerful common interest in reducing the threat of a nuclear war i will sign no agreement which does not enhance our national security  salt ii does not rely on trust it will be verifiable we have very sophisticated proven means including our satellites to determine for ourselves whether or not the soviet union is meeting its treaty obligations i will sign no agreement which cannot be verified  the american nuclear deterrent will remain strong after salt ii for example just one of our relatively invulnerable poseidon submarinescomprising less than 2 percent of our total nuclear force of submarines aircraft and landbased missilescarries enough warheads to destroy every large and mediumsized city in the soviet union our deterrent is overwhelming and i will sign no agreement unless our deterrent force will remain overwhelming  a salt agreement of course cannot substitute for wise diplomacy or a strong defense nor will it end the danger of nuclear war but it will certainly reduce that danger it will strengthen our efforts to ban nuclear tests and to stop the spread of atomic weapons to other nations and it can begin the process of negotiating new agreements which will further limit nuclear arms  the path of arms control backed by a strong defense the path our nation and every president has walked for 30 years can lead to a world of law and of international negotiation and consultation in which all peoples might live in peace in this year 1979 nothing is more important than that the congress and the people of the united states resolve to continue with me on that path of nuclear arms control and world peace this is paramount  ive outlined some of the changes that have transformed the world and which are continuing as we meet here tonight but we in america need not fear change the values on which our nation was founded individual liberty selfdetermination the potential for human fulfillment in freedom all of these endure we find these democratic principles praised even in books smuggled out of totalitarian nations and on wallposters in lands which we thought were closed to our influence our country has regained its special place of leadership in the worldwide struggle for human rights and that is a commitment that we must keep at home as well as abroad  the civil rights revolution freed all americans black and white but its full promise still remains unrealized i will continue to work with all my strength for equal opportunity for all americansand for affirmative action for those who carry the extra burden of past denial of equal opportunity  we remain committed to improving our labor laws to better protect the rights of american workers and our nation must make it clear that the legal rights of women as citizens are guaranteed under the laws of our land by ratifying the equal rights amendment  as long as im president at home and around the world americas examples and americas influence will be marshaled to advance the cause of human rights  to establish those values two centuries ago a bold generation of americans risked their property their position and life itself we are their heirs and they are sending us a message across the centuries the words they made so vivid are now growing faintly indistinct because they are not heard often enough they are words like justice equality unity truth sacrifice liberty faith and love  these words remind us that the duty of our generation of americans is to renew our nations faith not focused just against foreign threats but against the threats of selfishness cynicism and apathy  the new foundation ive discussed tonight can help us build a nation and a world where every child is nurtured and can look to the future with hope where the resources now wasted on war can be turned towards meeting human needs where all people have enough to eat a decent home and protection against disease  it can help us build a nation and a world where all people are free to seek the truth and to add to human understanding so that all of us may live our lives in peace  tonight i ask you the members of the congress to join me in building that new foundation a better foundation for our beloved country and our world  thank you very much  
188, State of the Union Address, Jimmy Carter,1980-01-21,  this last few months has not been an easy time for any of us as we meet tonight it has never been more clear that the state of our union depends on the state of the world and tonight as throughout our own generation freedom and peace in the world depend on the state of our union  the 1980s have been born in turmoil strife and change this is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and its a time that tests our wisdom and our skills  at this time in iran 50 americans are still held captive innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy also at this moment massive soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of afghanistan these two actsone of international terrorism and one of military aggressionpresent a serious challenge to the united states of america and indeed to all the nations of the world together we will meet these threats to peace  im determined that the united states will remain the strongest of all nations but our power will never be used to initiate a threat to the security of any nation or to the rights of any human being we seek to be and to remain securea nation at peace in a stable world but to be secure we must face the world as it is  three basic developments have helped to shape our challenges the steady growth and increased projection of soviet military power beyond its own borders the overwhelming dependence of the western democracies on oil supplies from the middle east and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world exemplified by the revolution in iran  each of these factors is important in its own right each interacts with the others all must be faced together squarely and courageously we will face these challenges and we will meet them with the best that is in us and we will not fail  in response to the abhorrent act in iran our nation has never been aroused and unified so greatly in peacetime our position is clear the united states will not yield to blackmail  we continue to pursue these specific goals first to protect the present and longrange interests of the united states secondly to preserve the lives of the american hostages and to secure as quickly as possible their safe release if possible to avoid bloodshed which might further endanger the lives of our fellow citizens to enlist the help of other nations in condemning this act of violence which is shocking and violates the moral and the legal standards of a civilized world and also to convince and to persuade the iranian leaders that the real danger to their nation lies in the north in the soviet union and from the soviet troops now in afghanistan and that the unwarranted iranian quarrel with the united states hampers their response to this far greater danger to them  if the american hostages are harmed a severe price will be paid we will never rest until every one of the american hostages are released  but now we face a broader and more fundamental challenge in this region because of the recent military action of the soviet union  now as during the last 3 12 decades the relationship between our country the united states of america and the soviet union is the most critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict  since the end of the second world war america has led other nations in meeting the challenge of mounting soviet power this has not been a simple or a static relationship between us there has been cooperation there has been competition and at times there has been confrontation  in the 1940s we took the lead in creating the atlantic alliance in response to the soviet unions suppression and then consolidation of its east european empire and the resulting threat of the warsaw pact to western europe  in the 1950s we helped to contain further soviet challenges in korea and in the middle east and we rearmed to assure the continuation of that containment  in the 1960s we met the soviet challenges in berlin and we faced the cuban missile crisis and we sought to engage the soviet union in the important task of moving beyond the cold war and away from confrontation  and in the 1970s three american presidents negotiated with the soviet leaders in attempts to halt the growth of the nuclear arms race we sought to establish rules of behavior that would reduce the risks of conflict and we searched for areas of cooperation that could make our relations reciprocal and productive not only for the sake of our two nations but for the security and peace of the entire world  in all these actions we have maintained two commitments to be ready to meet any challenge by soviet military power and to develop ways to resolve disputes and to keep the peace  preventing nuclear war is the foremost responsibility of the two superpowers thats why weve negotiated the strategic arms limitation treatiessalt i and salt ii especially now in a time of great tension observing the mutual constraints imposed by the terms of these treaties will be in the best interest of both countries and will help to preserve world peace i will consult very closely with the congress on this matter as we strive to control nuclear weapons that effort to control nuclear weapons will not be abandoned  we superpowers also have the responsibility to exercise restraint in the use of our great military force the integrity and the independence of weaker nations must not be threatened they must know that in our presence they are secure  but now the soviet union has taken a radical and an aggressive new step its using its great military power against a relatively defenseless nation the implications of the soviet invasion of afghanistan could pose the most serious threat to the peace since the second world war  the vast majority of nations on earth have condemned this latest soviet attempt to extend its colonial domination of others and have demanded the immediate withdrawal of soviet troops the moslem world is especially and justifiably outraged by this aggression against an islamic people no action of a world power has ever been so quickly and so overwhelmingly condemned but verbal condemnation is not enough the soviet union must pay a concrete price for their aggression  while this invasion continues we and the other nations of the world cannot conduct business as usual with the soviet union thats why the united states has imposed stiff economic penalties on the soviet union i will not issue any permits for soviet ships to fish in the coastal waters of the united states ive cut soviet access to hightechnology equipment and to agricultural products ive limited other commerce with the soviet union and ive asked our allies and friends to join with us in restraining their own trade with the soviets and not to replace our own embargoed items and i have notified the olympic committee that with soviet invading forces in afghanistan neither the american people nor i will support sending an olympic team to moscow  the soviet union is going to have to answer some basic questions will it help promote a more stable international environment in which its own legitimate peaceful concerns can be pursued or will it continue to expand its military power far beyond its genuine security needs and use that power for colonial conquest the soviet union must realize that its decision to use military force in afghanistan will be costly to every political and economic relationship it values  the region which is now threatened by soviet troops in afghanistan is of great strategic importance it contains more than twothirds of the worlds exportable oil the soviet effort to dominate afghanistan has brought soviet military forces to within 300 miles of the indian ocean and close to the straits of hormuz a waterway through which most of the worlds oil must flow the soviet union is now attempting to consolidate a strategic position therefore that poses a grave threat to the free movement of middle east oil  this situation demands careful thought steady nerves and resolute action not only for this year but for many years to come it demands collective efforts to meet this new threat to security in the persian gulf and in southwest asia it demands the participation of all those who rely on oil from the middle east and who are concerned with global peace and stability and it demands consultation and close cooperation with countries in the area which might be threatened  meeting this challenge will take national will diplomatic and political wisdom economic sacrifice and of course military capability we must call on the best that is in us to preserve the security of this crucial region  let our position be absolutely clear an attempt by any outside force to gain control of the persian gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the united states of america and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary including military force  during the past 3 years you have joined with me to improve our own security and the prospects for peace not only in the vital oilproducing area of the persian gulf region but around the world weve increased annually our real commitment for defense and we will sustain this increase of effort throughout the five year defense program its imperative that congress approve this strong defense budget for 1981 encompassing a 5percent real growth in authorizations without any reduction  we are also improving our capability to deploy us military forces rapidly to distant areas weve helped to strengthen nato and our other alliances and recently we and other nato members have decided to develop and to deploy modernized intermediaterange nuclear forces to meet an unwarranted and increased threat from the nuclear weapons of the soviet union  we are working with our allies to prevent conflict in the middle east the peace treaty between egypt and israel is a notable achievement which represents a strategic asset for america and which also enhances prospects for regional and world peace we are now engaged in further negotiations to provide full autonomy for the people of the west bank and gaza to resolve the palestinian issue in all its aspects and to preserve the peace and security of israel let no one doubt our commitment to the security of israel in a few days we will observe an historic event when israel makes another major withdrawal from the sinai and when ambassadors will be exchanged between israel and egypt  weve also expanded our own sphere of friendship our deep commitment to human rights and to meeting human needs has improved our relationship with much of the third world our decision to normalize relations with the peoples republic of china will help to preserve peace and stability in asia and in the western pacific  weve increased and strengthened our naval presence in the indian ocean and we are now making arrangements for key naval and air facilities to be used by our forces in the region of northeast africa and the persian gulf  weve reconfirmed our 1959 agreement to help pakistan preserve its independence and its integrity the united states will take action consistent with our own laws to assist pakistan in resisting any outside aggression and im asking the congress specifically to reaffirm this agreement im also working along with the leaders of other nations to provide additional military and economic aid for pakistan that request will come to you in just a few days  finally we are prepared to work with other countries in the region to share a cooperative security framework that respects differing values and political beliefs yet which enhances the independence security and prosperity of all  all these efforts combined emphasize our dedication to defend and preserve the vital interests of the region and of the nation which we represent and those of our alliesin europe and the pacific and also in the parts of the world which have such great strategic importance to us stretching especially through the middle east and southwest asia with your help i will pursue these efforts with vigor and with determination you and i will act as necessary to protect and to preserve our nations security  the men and women of americas armed forces are on duty tonight in many parts of the world im proud of the job they are doing and i know you share that pride i believe that our volunteer forces are adequate for current defense needs and i hope that it will not become necessary to impose a draft however we must be prepared for that possibility for this reason i have determined that the selective service system must now be revitalized i will send legislation and budget proposals to the congress next month so that we can begin registration and then meet future mobilization needs rapidly if they arise  we also need clear and quick passage of a new charter to define the legal authority and accountability of our intelligence agencies we will guarantee that abuses do not recur but we must tighten our controls on sensitive intelligence information and we need to remove unwarranted restraints on americas ability to collect intelligence  the decade ahead will be a time of rapid change as nations everywhere seek to deal with new problems and ageold tensions but america need have no fear we can thrive in a world of change if we remain true to our values and actively engaged in promoting world peace we will continue to work as we have for peace in the middle east and southern africa we will continue to build our ties with developing nations respecting and helping to strengthen their national independence which they have struggled so hard to achieve and we will continue to support the growth of democracy and the protection of human rights  in repressive regimes popular frustrations often have no outlet except through violence but when peoples and their governments can approach their problems together through open democratic methods the basis for stability and peace is far more solid and far more enduring that is why our support for human rights in other countries is in our own national interest as well as part of our own national character  peacea peace that preserves freedomremains americas first goal in the coming years as a mighty nation we will continue to pursue peace but to be strong abroad we must be strong at home and in order to be strong we must continue to face up to the difficult issues that confront us as a nation today  the crises in iran and afghanistan have dramatized a very important lesson our excessive dependence on foreign oil is a clear and present danger to our nations security the need has never been more urgent at long last we must have a clear comprehensive energy policy for the united states  as you well know i have been working with the congress in a concentrated and persistent way over the past 3 years to meet this need we have made progress together but congress must act promptly now to complete final action on this vital energy legislation our nation will then have a major conservation effort important initiatives to develop solar power realistic pricing based on the true value of oil strong incentives for the production of coal and other fossil fuels in the united states and our nations most massive peacetime investment in the development of synthetic fuels  the american people are making progress in energy conservation last year we reduced overall petroleum consumption by 8 percent and gasoline consumption by 5 percent below what it was the year before now we must do more  after consultation with the governors we will set gasoline conservation goals for each of the 50 states and i will make them mandatory if these goals are not met  ive established an import ceiling for 1980 of 82 million barrels a daywell below the level of foreign oil purchases in 1977 i expect our imports to be much lower than this but the ceiling will be enforced by an oil import fee if necessary im prepared to lower these imports still further if the other oilconsuming countries will join us in a fair and mutual reduction if we have a serious shortage i will not hesitate to impose mandatory gasoline rationing immediately  the single biggest factor in the inflation rate last year the increase in the inflation rate last year was from one cause the skyrocketing prices of opec oil we must take whatever actions are necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign oiland at the same time reduce inflation  as individuals and as families few of us can produce energy by ourselves but all of us can conserve energyevery one of us every day of our lives tonight i call on youin fact all the people of americato help our nation conserve energy eliminate waste make 1980 indeed a year of energy conservation  of course we must take other actions to strengthen our nations economy  first we will continue to reduce the deficit and then to balance the federal budget  second as we continue to work with business to hold down prices well build also on the historic national accord with organized labor to restrain pay increases in a fair fight against inflation  third we will continue our successful efforts to cut paperwork and to dismantle unnecessary government regulation  fourth we will continue our progress in providing jobs for america concentrating on a major new program to provide training and work for our young people especially minority youth it has been said that a mind is a terrible thing to waste we will give our young people new hope for jobs and a better life in the 1980s  and fifth we must use the decade of the 1980s to attack the basic structural weaknesses and problems in our economy through measures to increase productivity savings and investment  with these energy and economic policies we will make america even stronger at home in this decadejust as our foreign and defense policies will make us stronger and safer throughout the world we will never abandon our struggle for a just and a decent society here at home thats the heart of americaand its the source of our ability to inspire other people to defend their own rights abroad  our material resources great as they are are limited our problems are too complex for simple slogans or for quick solutions we cannot solve them without effort and sacrifice walter lippmann once reminded us you took the good things for granted now you must earn them again for every right that you cherish you have a duty which you must fulfill for every good which you wish to preserve you will have to sacrifice your comfort and your ease there is nothing for nothing any longer  our challenges are formidable but theres a new spirit of unity and resolve in our country we move into the 1980s with confidence and hope and a bright vision of the america we want an america strong and free an america at peace an america with equal rights for all citizensand for women guaranteed in the united states constitutionan america with jobs and good health and good education for every citizen an america with a clean and bountiful life in our cities and on our farms an america that helps to feed the world an america secure in filling its own energy needs an america of justice tolerance and compassion for this vision to come true we must sacrifice but this national commitment will be an exciting enterprise that will unify our people  together as one people let us work to build our strength at home and together as one indivisible union let us seek peace and security throughout the world  together let us make of this time of challenge and danger a decade of national resolve and of brave achievement  thank you very much  
189, State of the Union Address, Jimmy Carter,1981-01-16,  to the congress of the united states  the state of the union is sound our economy is recovering from a recession a national energy plan is in place and our dependence on foreign oil is decreasing we have been at peace for four uninterrupted years  but our nation has serious problems inflation and unemployment are unacceptably high the world oil market is increasingly tight there are trouble spots throughout the world and 52 american hostages are being held in iran against international law and against every precept of human affairs  however i firmly believe that as a result of the progress made in so many domestic and international areas over the past four years our nation is stronger wealthier more compassionate and freer than it was four years ago i am proud of that fact and i believe the congress should be proud as well for so much of what has been accomplished over the past four years has been due to the hard work insights and cooperation of congress i applaud the congress for its efforts and its achievements  in this state of the union message i want to recount the achievements and progress of the last four years and to offer recommendations to the congress for this year while my term as president will end before the 97th congress begins its work in earnest i hope that my recommendations will serve as a guide for the direction this country should take so we build on the record of the past four years  record of progress  when i took office our nation faced a number of serious domestic and international problems  no national energy policy existed and our dependence on foreign oil was rapidly increasing  public trust in the integrity and openness of the government was low  the federal government was operating inefficiently in administering essential programs and policies  major social problems were being ignored or poorly addressed by the federal government  our defense posture was declining as a result of a defense budget which was continuously shrinking in real terms  the strength of the nato alliance needed to be bolstered  tensions between israel and egypt threatened another middle east war and  americas resolve to oppose human rights violations was under serious question  over the past 48 months clear progress has been made in solving the challenges we found in january of 1977  almost all of our comprehensive energy program have been enacted and the department of energy has been established to administer the program confidence in the governments integrity has been restored and respect for the governments openness and fairness has been renewed  the government has been made more effective and efficient the civil service system was completely reformed for the first time this century  14 reorganization initiatives have been proposed to the congress approved and implemented  two new cabinet departments have been created to consolidate and streamline the governments handling of energy and education problems  inspectors general have been placed in each cabinet department to combat fraud waste and other abuses  the regulatory process has been reformed through creation of the regulatory council implementation of executive order 12044 and its requirement for costimpact analyses elimination of unnecessary regulation and passage of the regulatory flexibility act  procedures have been established to assure citizen participation in government  and the airline trucking rail and communications industries are being deregulated  critical social problems many long ignored by the federal government have been addressed directly  an urban policy was developed and implemented to reverse the decline in our urban areas  the social security system was refinanced to put it on a sound financial basis  the humphreyhawkins full employment act was enacted  federal assistance for education was expanded by more than 75 percent  the minimum wage was increased to levels needed to ease the effects of inflation  affirmative action has been pursued aggressively more blacks hispanics and women have been appointed to senior government positions and to judgeships than at any other time in our history  the era ratification deadline was extended to aid the ratification effort  and minority business procurement by the federal government has more than doubled  the nations first sectoral policies were put in place for the auto and steel industries with my administration demonstrating the value of cooperation between the government business and labor  reversing previous trends real defense spending has increased every year since 1977  the real increase in fy 1980 defense spending is well above 3 percent and i expect fy 1981 defense spending to be even higher  looking ahead the defense program i am proposing is premised on a real increase in defense spending over the next five years of 20 percent or more  the nato alliance has proven its unity in responding to the situations in eastern europe and southwest asia and in agreeing on the issues to be addressed in the review of the helsinki final act currently underway in madrid  the peace process in the middle east established at camp david and by the peace treaty between egypt and israel is being buttressed on two fronts steady progress in the normalization of egyptianisraeli relations in many fields and the commitment of both egypt and israel with united states assistance to see through to successful conclusion the autonomy negotiations for the west bank and gaza  the panama canal treaties have been put into effect which has helped to improve relations with latin america  we have continued this nations strong commitment to the pursuit of human rights throughout the world evenhandedly and objectively  our commitment to a worldwide human rights policy has remained firm  and many other countries have given high priority to it  our resolve to oppose aggression such as the illegal invasion of the soviet union into afghanistan has been supported by tough action  i ensuring economic strength economy  during the last decade our nation has withstood a series of economic shocks unprecedented in peacetime the most dramatic of these has been the explosive increases of opec oil prices but we have also faced world commodity shortages natural disasters agricultural shortages and major challenges to world peace and security our ability to deal with these shocks has been impaired because of a decrease in the growth of productivity and the persistence of underlying inflationary forces built up over the past 15 years  nevertheless the economy has proved to be remarkably resilient real output has grown at an average rate of 3 percent per year since i took office and employment has grown by 10 percent we have added about 8 million productive private sector jobs to the economy however unacceptably high inflationthe most difficult economic problem i have facedpersists  this inflationwhich threatens the growth productivity and stability of our economyrequires that we restrain the growth of the budget to the maximum extent consistent with national security and human compassion i have done so in my earlier budgets and in my fy 82 budget however while restraint is essential to any appropriate economic policy high inflation cannot be attributed solely to government spending the growth in budget outlays has been more the result of economic factors than the cause of them  we are now in the early stages of economic recovery following a short recession typically a postrecessionary period has been marked by vigorous economic growth aided by antirecessionary policy measures such as large tax cuts or big stimulation spending programs i have declined to recommend such actions to stimulate economic activity because the persistent inflationary pressures that beset our economy today dictate a restrained fiscal policy  accordingly i am asking the congress to postpone until january 1 1982 the personal tax reductions i had earlier proposed to take effect on january 1 of this year  however my 1982 budget proposes significant tax changes to increase the sources of financing for business investment while emphasizing the need for continued fiscal restraint this budget takes the first major step in a longterm tax reduction program designed to increase capital formation the failure of our nations capital stock to grow at a rate that keeps pace with its labor force has clearly been one cause of our productivity slowdown higher investment rates are also critically needed to meet our nations energy needs and to replace energyinefficient plants and equipment with new energysaving physical plants the level of investment that is called for will not occur in the absence of policies to encourage it  therefore my budget proposes a major liberalization of tax allowances for depreciation as well as simplified depreciation accounting increasing the allowable rates by about 40 percent i am also proposing improvements in the investment tax credit making it refundable to meet the investment needs of firms with no current earnings  these two proposals along with carefullyphased tax reductions for individuals will improve both economic efficiency and tax equity i urge the congress to enact legislation along the lines and timetable i have proposed  the 1982 budget  the fy 1982 budget i have sent to the congress continues our fouryear policy of prudence and restraint while the budget deficits during my term are higher than i would have liked their size is determined for the most part by economic conditions and in spite of these conditions the relative size of the deficit continues to decline in 1976 before i took office the budget deficit equalled 4 percent of gross national product it had been cut to 23 percent in the 1980 fiscal year just ended my 1982 budget contains a deficit estimated to be less than 1 percent of our gross national product  the rate of growth in federal spending has been held to a minimum nevertheless outlays are still rising more rapidly than many had anticipated the result of many powerful forces in our society  we face a threat to our security as events in afghanistan the middle east and eastern europe make clear we have a steadily aging population and as a result the biggest single increase in the federal budget is the rising cost of retirement programs particularly social security we face other important domestic needs to continue responsibility for the disadvantaged to provide the capital needed by our cities and our transportation systems to protect our environment to revitalize american industry and to increase the export of american goods and services so essential to the creation of jobs and a trade surplus  yet the federal government itself may not always be the proper source of such assistance for example it must not usurp functions if they can be more appropriately decided upon managed and financed by the private sector or by state and local governments my administration has always sought to consider the proper focus of responsibility for the most efficient resolution of problems  we have also recognized the need to simplify the system of grants to state and local governments i have again proposed several grant consolidations in the 1982 budget including a new proposal that would consolidate several highway programs  the pressures for growth in federal use of national resources are great my administration has initiated many new approaches to cope with these pressures we started a multiyear budget system and we began a system for controlling federal credit programs yet in spite of increasing needs to limit spending growth we have consistently adhered to these strong budget principles  our nations armed forces must always stand sufficiently strong to deter aggression and to assure our security an effective national energy plan is essential to increase domestic production of oil and gas to encourage conservation of our scarce energy resources to stimulate conversion to more abundant fuels and to reduce our trade deficit the essential human needs for our citizens must be given the highest priority the federal government must lead the way in investment in the nations technological future the federal government has an obligation to nurture and protect our environmentthe common resource birthright and sustenance of the american people  my 1982 budget continues to support these principles it also proposes responsible tax reductions to encourage a more productive economy and adequate funding of our highest priority programs within an overall policy of constraint  fiscal restraint must be continued in the years ahead budgets must be tight enough to convince those who set wages and prices that the federal government is serious about fighting inflation but not so tight as to choke off all growth  careful budget policy should be supplemented by other measures designed to reduce inflation at lower cost in lost output and employment these other steps include measures to increase investmentsuch as the tax proposals included in my 1982 budgetand measures to increase competition and productivity in our economy voluntary incomes policies can also directly influence wages and prices in the direction of moderation and thereby bring inflation down faster and at lower cost to the economy through a taxbased incomes policy tip we could provide tax incentives for firms and workers to moderate their wage and price increases in the coming years control of federal expenditures can make possible periodic tax reductions the congress should therefore begin now to evaluate the potentialities of a tip program so that when the next round of tax reductions is appropriate a tip program will be seriously considered  employment  during the last four years we have given top priority to meeting the needs of workers and providing additional job opportunities to those who seek work since the end of 1976  almost 9 million new jobs have been added to the nations economy total employment has reached 97 million more jobs than ever before are held by women minorities and young people employment over the past four years has increased by 17 for adult women 11 for blacks and 30 for hispanics employment of black teenagers increased by more than 5 reversing the decline that occurred in the previous eight years  major initiatives launched by this administration helped bring about these accomplishments and have provided a solid foundation for employment and training policy in the 1980s in 1977 as part of the comprehensive economic stimulus program  425000 public service jobs were created a 1 billion youth employment initiative funded 200000 jobs the doubling of the job corps to 44000 slots began and 1 million summer youth jobs were approveda 25 percent increase  in 1978  the humphreyhawkins full employment act became law the 400 million private sector initiatives program was begun a targeted jobs tax credit for disadvantaged youth and others with special employment barriers was enacted the comprehensive employment and training act was reauthorized for four years  in 1979  a 6 billion welfare reform proposal was introduced with funding for 400000 public service jobs welfare reform demonstration projects were launched in communities around the country the vice president initiated a nationwide review of youth unemployment in this country  in 1980  the findings of the vice presidents task force revealed the major education and employment deficits that exist for poor and minority youngsters as a result a 2 billion youth education and jobs initiative was introduced to provide unemployed youth with the basic education and work experience they need to compete in the labor market of the 1980s as part of the economic revitalization program several steps were proposed to aid workers in high unemployment communities  an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits for the long term unemployed 600 million to train the disadvantaged and unemployed for new private sector jobs positive adjustment demonstrations to aid workers in declining industries the important title vii private sector initiatives program was reauthorized for an additional two years  in addition to making significant progress in helping the disadvantaged and unemployed important gains were realized for all workers  an historic national accord with organized labor made it possible for the views of working men and women to be heard as the nations economic and domestic policies were formulated the mine safety and health act brought about improved working conditions for the nations 500000 miners substantial reforms of occupational safety and health administration were accomplished to help reduce unnecessary burdens on business and to focus on major health and safety problems the minimum wage was increased over a four year period from 230 to 335 an hour the black lung benefit reform act was signed into law attempts to weaken davisbacon act were defeated  while substantial gains have been made in the last four years continued efforts are required to ensure that this progress is continued  government must continue to make labor a full partner in the policy decisions that affect the interests of working men and women a broad bipartisan effort to combat youth unemployment must be sustained compassionate reform of the nations welfare system should be continued with employment opportunities provided for those able to work workers in declining industries should be provided new skills and help in finding employment  trade  over the past year the us trade picture improved as a result of solid export gains in both manufactured and agricultural products agricultural exports reached a new record of over 40 billion while manufactured exports have grown by 24 percent to a record 144 billion in these areas the united states recorded significant surpluses of 24 billion and 19 billion respectively while our oil imports remained a major drain on our foreign exchange earnings that drain was somewhat moderated by a 19 percent decline in the volume of oil imports  us trade negotiators made significant progress over the past year in assuring effective implementation of the agreements negotiated during the tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations agreements reached with the japanese government for example will assure that the united states will be able to expand its exports to the japanese market in such key areas as telecommunications equipment tobacco and lumber efforts by us trade negotiators also helped to persuade a number of key developing countries to accept many of the nontariff codes negotiated during the multilateral trade negotiations this will assure that these countries will increasingly assume obligations under the international trading system  a difficult world economic environment posed a challenge for the management of trade relations us trade negotiators were called upon to manage serious sectoral problems in such areas as steel and helped to assure that us chemical exports will have continued access to the european market  close consultations with the private sector in the united states have enabled us trade negotiators to pinpoint obstacles to us trade in services and to build a basis for future negotiations services have been an increasingly important source of export earnings for the united states and the united states must assure continued and increased access to foreign markets  the trade position of the united states has improved but vigorous efforts are needed in a number of areas to assure continued market access for us exports particularly agricultural and high technology products in which the united states continues to have a strong competitive edge continued efforts are also needed to remove many domestic disincentives which now hamper us export growth and we must ensure that countries do not manipulate investment or impose investment performance requirements which distort trade and cost us jobs in this country  in short we must continue to seek freebut fairtrade that is the policy my administration has pursued from the beginning even in areas where foreign competition has clearly affected our domestic industry in the steel industry for instance we have put trigger price mechanism into place to help prevent the dumping of steel that action has strengthened the domestic steel industry in the automobile industry we have worked without resort to import quotasto strengthen the industrys ability to modernize and compete effectively  small business  i have often said that there is nothing small about small business in america these firms account for nearly onehalf our gross national product over half of new technology and much more than half of the jobs created by industry  because this sector of the economy is the very lifeblood of our national economy we have done much together to improve the competitive climate for smaller firms these concerted efforts have been an integral part of my program to revitalize the economy  they include my campaign to shrink substantially the cash and time consuming red tape burden imposed on business they include my personallydirected policy of ambitiously increasing the federal contracting dollars going to small firms especially those owned by women and minorities and they include my proposals to reinvigorate existing small businesses and assist the creation of new ones through tax reform financing assistance market expansion and support of product innovation  many of my initiatives to facilitate the creation and growth of small businesses were made in response to the white house conference on small business which i convened my administration began the implementation of most of the ideas produced last year by that citizens advisory body others need to be addressed i have proposed the reconvening of the conference next year to review progress reassess priorities and set new goals in the interim i hope that the incoming administration and the new congress will work with the committee i have established to keep these business development ideas alive and help implement conference recommendations  minority business  one of the most successful developments of my administration has been the growth and strengthening of minority business this is the first administration to put the issue on the policy agenda as a matter of major importance to implement the results of our early efforts in this field i submitted legislation to congress designed to further the development of minority business  we have reorganized the office of minority business into the minority business development administration in the department of commerce mbda has already proven to be a major factor in assisting minority businesses to achieve equitable competitive positions in the marketplace  the federal governments procurement from minorityowned firms has nearly tripled since i took office federal deposits in minorityowned banks have more than doubled and minority ownership of radio and television stations has nearly doubled the sba administered 8a pilot program for procurement with the army proved to be successful and i recently expanded the number of agencies involved to include nasa and the departments of energy and transportation  i firmly believe the critical path to full freedom and equality for americas minorities rests with the ability of minority communities to participate competitively in the free enterprise system i believe the government has a fundamental responsibility to assist in the development of minority business and i hope the progress made in the last four years will continue  ii creating energy security  since i took office my highest legislative priorities have involved the reorientation and redirection of us energy activities and for the first time to establish a coordinated national energy policy the struggle to achieve that policy has been long and difficult but the accomplishments of the past four years make clear that our country is finally serious about the problems caused by our overdependence on foreign oil our progress should not be lost we must rely on and encourage multiple forms of energy productioncoal crude oil natural gas solar nuclear syntheticsand energy conservation the framework put in place over the last four years will enable us to do this  national energy policy  as a result of actions my administration and the congress have taken over the past four years our country finally has a national energy policy  under my program of phased decontrol domestic crude oil price controls will end september 30 1981 as a result exploratory drilling activities have reached an alltime high prices for new natural gas are being decontrolled under the natural gas policy actand natural gas production is now at an all time high the supply shortages of several years ago have been eliminated the windfall profits tax on crude oil has been enacted providing 227 billion over ten years for assistance to lowincome households increased mass transit funding and a massive investment in the production and development of alternative energy sources the synthetic fuels corporation has been established to help private companies build the facilities to produce energy from synthetic fuels solar energy funding has been quadrupled solar energy tax credits enacted and a solar energy and energy conservation bank has been established a route has been chosen to bring natural gas from the north slope of alaska to the lower 48 states coal production and consumption incentives have been increased and coal production is now at its highest level in history a gasoline rationing plan has been approved by congress for possible use in the event of a severe energy supply shortage or interruption gasohol production has been dramatically increased with a program being put in place to produce 500 million gallons of alcohol fuel by the end of this yearan amount that could enable gasohol to meet the demand for 10 percent of all unleaded gasoline new energy conservation incentives have been provided for individuals businesses and communities and conservation has increased dramatically the us has reduced oil imports by 25 percentor 2 million barrels per dayover the past four years  increased development of domestic energy sources  although it is essential that the nation reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels and complete the transition to reliance on domestic renewable sources of energy it is also important that this transition be accomplished in an orderly economic and environmentally sound manner to this end the administration has launched several initiatives  leasing of oil and natural gas on federal lands particularly the outer continental shelf has been accelerated at the same time as the administration has reformed leasing procedures through the 1978 amendments to the outer continental shelf lands act in 1979 the interior department held six ocs lease sales the greatest number ever which resulted in federal receipts of 65 billion another record the fiveyear ocs leasing schedule was completed requiring 36 sales over the next five years  since 1971 no general federal coal lease sales were suspended over the past four years the administration has completely revised the federal coal leasing program to bring it into compliance with the requirements of 1976 federal land planning and management act and other statutory provisions the program is designed to balance the competing interests that affect resource development on public lands and to ensure that adequate supplies of coal will be available to meet national needs as a result the first general competitive federal coal lease sale in ten years will be held this month  in july 1980 i signed into law the energy security act of 1980 which established the synthetic fuels corporation the corporation is designed to spur the development of commercial technologies for production of synthetic fuels such as liquid and gaseous fuels from coal and the production of oil from oil shale the act provides the corporation with an initial 22 billion to accomplish these objectives the principal purpose of the legislation is to ensure that the nation will have available in the late 1980s the option to undertake commercial development of synthetic fuels if that becomes necessary the energy security act also provides significant incentives for the development of gasohol and biomass fuels thereby enhancing the nations supply of alternative energy sources  commitment to a sustainable energy future  the administrations 1977 national energy plan marked an historic departure from the policies of previous administrations the plan stressed the importance of both energy production and conservation to achieving our ultimate national goal of relying primarily on secure sources of energy the national energy plan made energy conservation a cornerstone of our national energy policy  in 1978 i initiated the administrations solar domestic policy review this represented the first step towards widespread introduction of renewable energy sources into the nations economy as a result of the review i issued the 1979 solar message to congress the first such message in the nations history the message outlined the administrations solar program and established an ambitious national goal for the year 2000 of obtaining 20 percent of this nations energy from solar and renewable sources the thrust of the federal solar program is to help industry develop solar energy sources by emphasizing basic research and development of solar technologies which are not currently economic such as photovoltaics which generate energy directly from the sun at the same time through tax incentives education and the solar energy and energy conservation bank the solar program seeks to encourage state and local governments industry and our citizens to expand their use of solar and renewable resource technologies currently available  as a result of these policies and programs the energy efficiency of the american economy has improved markedly and investments in renewable energy sources have grown significantly it now takes 3 12 percent less energy to produce a constant dollar of gnp than it did in january 1977 this increase in efficiency represents a savings of over 13 million barrels per day of oil equivalent about the level of total oil production now occurring in alaska over the same period federal support for conservation and solar energy has increased by more than 3000 percent to 33 billion in fy 1981 including the tax credits for solar energy and energy conservation investmentsthese credits are expected to amount to 12 billion in fy 1981 and 15 billion in fy 1982  commitment to nuclear safety and security  since january 1977 significant progress has been achieved in resolving three critical problems resulting from the use of nuclear energy radioactive waste management nuclear safety and weapons proliferation  in 1977 the administration announced its nuclear nonproliferation policy and initiated the international fuel cycle evaluation in 1978 congress passed the nuclear nonproliferation act an historic piece of legislation  in february 1980 the administration transmitted its nuclear waste management policy to the congress this policy was a major advance over all previous efforts the principal aspects of that policy are acknowledging the seriousness of the problem and the numerous technical and institutional issues adopting a technically and environmentally conservative approach to the first permanent repository and providing the states with significant involvement in nuclear waste disposal decisions by creating the state planning council while much of the plan can be and is being implemented administratively some new authorities are needed the congress should give early priority to enacting provisions for awayfromreactor storage and the state planning council  the accident at three mile island made the nation acutely aware of the safety risks posed by nuclear power plants in response the president established the kemeny commission to review the accident and make recommendations virtually all of the commissions substantive recommendations were adopted by the administration and are now being implemented by the nuclear regulatory commission the congress adopted the presidents proposed plan for the nuclear regulatory commission and the nuclear safety oversight committee was established to ensure that the administrations decisions were implemented  nuclear safety will remain a vital concern in the years ahead we must continue to press ahead for the safe secure disposal of radioactive wastes and prevention of nuclear proliferation  while significant growth in foreign demand for us steam coal is foreseen congestion must be removed at major us coal exporting ports such as hampton roads virginia and baltimore maryland my administration has worked through the interagency coal task force study to promote cooperation and coordination of resources between shippers railroads vessel broker operators and port operators and to determine the most appropriate federal role in expanding and modernizing coal export facilities including dredging deeper channels at selected ports as a result of the task forces efforts administrative steps have been taken by the corps of engineers to reduce significantly the amount of time required for planning and economic review of port dredging proposals the administration has also recommended that the congress enact legislation to give the president generic authority to recommend appropriations for channel dredging activities private industry will of course play the major role in developing the united states coal export facilities but the government must continue to work to facilitate transportation to foreign markets  iii enhancing basic human and social needs  for too long prior to my administration many of our nations basic human and social needs were being ignored or handled insensitively by the federal government over the last four years we have significantly increased funding for many of the vital programs in these areas developed new programs where needs were unaddressed targeted federal support to those individuals and areas most in need of our assistance and removed barriers that have unnecessarily kept many disadvantaged citizens from obtaining aid for their most basic needs  our record has produced clear progress in the effort to solve some of the countrys fundamental human and social problems my administration and the congress working together have demonstrated that government must and can meet our citizens basic human and social needs in a responsible and compassionate way  but there is an unfinished agenda still before the congress if we are to meet our obligations to help all americans realize the dreams of sound health care decent housing effective social services a good education and a meaningful job important legislation still must be enacted national health insurance welfare reform child health assessment program are before the congress and i urge their passage  health national health plan  during my administration i proposed to congress a national health plan which will enable the country to reach the goal of comprehensive universal health care coverage the legislation i submitted lays the foundation for this comprehensive plan and addresses the most serious problems of health financing and delivery it is realistic and enactable it does not overpromise or overspend and as a result can be the solution to the thirty years of congressional battles on national health insurance my plan includes the following key features  nearly 15 million additional poor would receive fullysubsidized comprehensive coverage prenatal and delivery services are provided for all pregnant women and coverage is provided for all acute care for infants in their first year of life the elderly and disabled would have a limit of 1250 placed on annual outofpocket medical expenses and would no longer face limits on hospital coverage all fulltime employees and their families would receive insurance against at least major medical expenses under mandated employer coverage medicare and medicaid would be combined and expanded into an umbrella federal program healthcare for increased program efficiency accountability and uniformity and strong cost controls and health system reforms would be implemented including greater incentives for health maintenance organizations  i urge the new congress to compare my plan with the alternativesprograms which either do too little to improve the health care needs of americans most in need or programs which would impose substantial financial burdens on the american taxpayers i hope the congress will see the need for and the benefits of my plan and work toward prompt enactment we cannot afford further delay in this vital area  health care cost control  inflation in health care costs remains unacceptably high throughout my administration legislation to reduce health care cost inflation was one of my highest priorities but was not passed by the congress therefore my fy 1982 budget proposes sharing the responsibility for health care cost control with the private sector through voluntary hospital cost guidelines and intensified monitoring in the longer term the health care reimbursement system must be reformed we must move away from inflationary costbased reimbursement and feeforservice and toward a system of prospective reimbursement under which health care providers would operate within predetermined budgets this reimbursement reform is essential to ultimately control inflation in health care costs and will be a significant challenge to the new congress  health promotion and disease prevention  during my administration the surgeon general released healthy people a landmark report on health promotion and disease prevention the report signals the growing consensus that the nations health strategy must be refocused in the 1980s to emphasize the prevention of disease specifically the report lays out measurable and achieveable goals in the reduction of mortality which can be reached by 1990  i urge the new congress to endorse the principles of healthy people and to adopt the recommendations to achieve its goals this will necessitate adoption of a broader concept of health care to include such areas as environmental health workplace health and safety commercial product safety traffic safety and health education promotion and information  maternal and child health  ensuring a healthy start in life for children remains not only a high priority of my administration but also one of the most cost effective forms of health care  when i took office immunization levels for preventable childhood diseases had fallen to 70 as a result of a concerted nationwide effort during my administration i am pleased to report that now at least 90 of children under 15 and virtually all schoolage children are immunized in addition reported cases of measles and mumps are at their lowest levels ever  under the national health plan i have proposed there would be no costsharing for prenatal and delivery services for all pregnant women and for acute care provided to infants in their first year of life these preventive services have extremely high returns in terms of improved newborn and longterm child health  under the child health assurance program chap legislation which i submitted to the congress and which passed the house an additional two million lowincome children under 18 would become eligible for medicaid benefits which would include special health assessments chap would also improve the continuity of care for the nearly 14 million children now eligible for medicaid an additional 100000 lowincome pregnant women would become eligible for prenatal care under the proposal i strongly urge the new congress to enact chap and thereby provide millions of needy children with essential health services the legislation has had strong bipartisan support which should continue as the details of the bill are completed  i also urge the new congress to provide strong support for two highly successful ongoing programs the special supplemental food program for women infants and children wic and family planning the food supplements under wic have been shown to effectively prevent ill health and thereby reduce later medical costs the family planning program has been effective at reducing unwanted pregnancies among lowincome women and adolescents  expansion of services to the poor and underserved  during my administration health services to the poor and underserved have been dramatically increased the number of national health service corps nhsc assignees providing services in medically underserved communities has grown from 500 in 1977 to nearly 3000 in 1981 the population served by the nhsc has more than tripled since 1977 the number of community health centers providing services in high priority underserved areas has doubled during my administration and will serve an estimated six million people in 1981 i strongly urge the new congress to support these highly successful programs  mental health  one of the most significant health achievements during my administration was the recent passage of the mental health systems act which grew out of recommendations of my commission on mental health i join many others in my gratitude to the first lady for her tireless and effective contribution to the passage of this important legislation  the act is designed to inaugurate a new era of federal and state partnership in the planning and provision of mental health services in addition the act specifically provides for prevention and support services to the chronically mentally ill to prevent unnecessary institutionalization and for the development of communitybased mental health services i urge the new congress to provide adequate support for the full and timely implementation of this act  health protection  with my active support the congress recently passed medigap legislation which provides for voluntary certification of health insurance policies supplemental to medicare to curb widespread abuses in this area  in the area of toxic agent control legislation which i submitted to the congress recently passed this will provide for a superfund to cover hazardous waste cleanup costs  in the area of accidental injury control we have established automobile safety standards and increased enforcement activities with respect to the 55 mph speed limit by the end of the decade these actions are expected to save over 13000 lives and 100000 serious injuries each year  i urge the new congress to continue strong support for all these activities  food and nutrition  building on the comprehensive reform of the food stamp program that i proposed and congress passed in 1977 my administration and the congress worked together in 1979 and 1980 to enact several other important changes in the program these changes will further simplify administration and reduce fraud and error will make the program more responsive to the needs of the elderly and disabled and will increase the cap on allowable program expenditures the food stamp act will expire at the end of fiscal 1981 it is essential that the new administration and the congress continue this program to ensure complete eradication of the debilitating malnutrition witnessed and documented among thousands of children in the 1960s  drug abuse prevention  at the beginning of my administration there were over a half million heroin addicts in the united states our continued emphasis on reducing the supply of heroin as well as providing treatment and rehabilitation to its victims has reduced the heroin addict population reduced the number of heroin overdose deaths by 80 and reduced the number of heroin related injuries by 50 we have also seen and encouraged a national movement of parents and citizens committed to reversing the very serious and disturbing trends of adolescent drug abuse  drug abuse in many forms will continue to detract however from the quality of life of many americans to prevent that i see four great challenges in the years ahead first we must deal aggressively with the supplies of illegal drugs at their source through joint crop destruction programs with foreign nations and increased law enforcement and border interdiction second we must look to citizens and parents across the country to help educate the increasing numbers of american youth who are experimenting with drugs to the dangers of drug abuse education is a key factor in reducing drug abuse third we must focus our efforts on drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace for not only does this abuse contribute to low productivity but it also destroys the satisfaction and sense of purpose all americans can gain from the work experience fourth we need a change in attitude from an attitude which condones the casual use of drugs to one that recognizes the appropriate use of drugs for medical purposes and condemns the inappropriate and harmful abuse of drugs i hope the congress and the new administration will take action to meet each of these challenges  education  the american people have always recognized that education is one of the soundest investments they can make the dividends are reflected in every dimension of our national lifefrom the strength of our economy and national security to the vitality of our music art and literature among the accomplishments that have given me the most satisfaction over the last four years are the contributions that my administration has been able to make to the wellbeing of students and educators throughout the country  this administration has collaborated successfully with the congress on landmark education legislation working with the congressional leadership my administration spotlighted the importance of education by creating a new department of education the department has given education a stronger voice at the federal level while at the same time reserving the actual control and operation of education to states localities and private institutions the department has successfully combined nearly 150 federal education programs into a cohesive streamlined organization that is more responsive to the needs of educators and students the department has made strides to cut red tape and paperwork and thereby to make the flow of federal dollars to school districts and institutions of higher education more efficient it is crucial that the department be kept intact and strengthened  our collaboration with the congress has resulted in numerous other important legislative accomplishments for education a little over two years ago i signed into law on the same day two major billsone benefiting elementary and secondary education and the other postsecondary education the education amendments of 1978 embodied nearly all of my administrations proposals for improvements in the elementary and secondary education act including important new programs to improve students achievement in the basic skills and to aid school districts with exceptionally high concentrations of children from lowincome families the middle income student assistance act legislation jointly sponsored by this administration and the congressional leadership expanded eligibility for needbased basic educational opportunity grants to approximately onethird of the students enrolled in postsecondary education and made many more students eligible for the first time for other types of grants workstudy and loans  just three and a half months ago my administration and the congress successfully concluded over two years of work on a major reauthorization bill that further expands benefits to postsecondary education reflected in the education amendments of 1980 are major administration recommendations for improvements in the higher education actincluding proposals for better loan access for students a new parent loan program simplified application procedures for student financial aid a strengthened federal commitment to developing colleges particularly the historically black institutions a new authorization for equipment and facilities modernization funding for the nations major research universities and revitalized international education programs  supplementing these legislative accomplishments have been important administrative actions aimed at reducing paperwork and simplifying regulations associated with federal education programs we also launched major initiatives to reduce the backlog of defaulted student loans and otherwise to curb fraud abuse and waste in education programs  to insure that the education enterprise is ready to meet the scientific and technological changes of the future we undertook a major study of the status of science and engineering education throughout the nation i hope that the findings from this report will serve as a springboard for needed reforms at all levels of education  i am proud that this administration has been able to provide the financial means to realize many of our legislative and administrative goals compared to the previous administrations last budget i have requested the largest overall increase in federal funding for education in our nations history my budget requests have been particularly sensitive to the needs of special populations like minorities women the educationally and economically disadvantaged the handicapped and students with limited englishspeaking ability at the same time i have requested significant increases for many programs designed to enhance the quality of american education including programs relating to important areas as diverse as international education research libraries museums and teacher centers  last year i proposed to the congress a major legislative initiative that would direct 2 billion into education and job training programs designed to alleviate youth unemployment through improved linkages between the schools and the work place this legislation generated bipartisan support but unfortunately action on it was not completed in the final rushed days of the 96th congress i urge the new congressas it undertakes broad efforts to strengthen the economy as well as more specific tasks like reauthorizing the vocational education actto make the needs of our nations unemployed youth a top priority for action only by combining a basic skills education program together with work training and employment incentives can we make substantial progress in eliminating one of the most severe social problems in our nationyouth unemployment particularly among minorities i am proud of the progress already made through passage of the youth employment and demonstration project act of 1977 and the substantial increase in our investment in youth employment programs the new legislation would cap these efforts  income security social security  one of the highest priorities of my administration has been to continue the tradition of effectiveness and efficiency widely associated with the social security program and to assure present and future beneficiaries that they will receive their benefits as expected the earned benefits that are paid monthly to retired and disabled american workers and their families provide a significant measure of economic protection to millions of people who might otherwise face retirement or possible disability with fear i have enacted changes to improve the benefits of many social security beneficiaries during my years as president  the last four years have presented a special set of concerns over the financial stability of the social security system shortly after taking office i proposed and congress enacted legislation to protect the stability of the old age and survivors trust fund and prevent the imminent exhaustion of the disability insurance trust fund and to correct a flaw in the benefit formula that was threatening the long run health of the entire social security system the actions taken by the congress at my request helped stabilize the system that legislation was later complemented by the disability insurance amendments of 1980 which further bolstered the disability insurance program and reduced certain inequities among beneficiaries  my commitment to the essential retirement and disability protection provided to 35 million people each month has been demonstrated by the fact that without interruption those beneficiaries have continued to receive their social security benefits including annual cost of living increases changing and unpredictable economic circumstances require that we continue to monitor the financial stability of the social security system to correct anticipated shortterm strains on the system i proposed last year that the three funds be allowed to borrow from one another and i urge the congress again this year to adopt such interfund borrowing to further strengthen the social security system and provide a greater degree of assurance to beneficiaries given projected future economic uncertainties additional action should be taken among the additional financing options available are borrowing from the general fund financing half of the hospital insurance fund with general revenues and increasing the payroll tax rate the latter option is particularly unpalatable given the significant increase in the tax rate already mandated in law  this administration continues to oppose cuts in basic social security benefits and taxing social security benefits the administration continues to support annual indexing of social security benefits  welfare reform  in 1979 i proposed a welfare reform package which offers solutions to some of the most urgent problems in our welfare system this proposal is embodied in two bills the work and training opportunities act and the social welfare reform amendments act the house passed the second of these two proposals within the framework of our present welfare system my reform proposals offer achievable means to increase selfsufficiency through work rather than welfare more adequate assistance to people unable to work the removal of inequities in coverage under current programs and fiscal relief needed by states and localities  our current welfare system is long overdue for serious reform the system is wasteful and not fully effective the legislation i have proposed will help eliminate inequities by establishing a national minimum benefit and by directly relating benefit levels to the poverty threshold it will reduce program complexity which leads to inefficiency and waste by simplifying and coordinating administration among different programs  i urge the congress to take action in this area along the lines i have recommended  child welfare  my administration has worked closely with the congress on legislation which is designed to improve greatly the child welfare services and foster care programs and to create a federal system of adoption assistance these improvements will be achieved with the recent enactment of hr 3434 the adoption assistance and child welfare act of 1980 the wellbeing of children in need of homes and their permanent placement have been a primary concern of my administration this legislation will ensure that children are not lost in the foster care system but instead will be returned to their families where possible or placed in permanent adoptive homes  lowincome energy assistance  in 1979 i proposed a program to provide an annual total of 16 billion to lowincome households which are hardest hit by rising energy bills with the cooperation of congress we were able to move quickly to provide assistance to eligible households in time to meet their winter heating bills  in response to the extreme heat conditions affecting many parts of the country during 1980 i directed the community services administration to make available over 27 million to assist lowincome individuals especially the elderly facing life threatening circumstances due to extreme heat  congress amended and reauthorized the lowincome energy assistance program for fiscal year 1981 and provided 185 billion to meet anticipated increasing need the need for a program to help lowincome households with rising energy expenses will not abate in the near future the lowincome energy assistance program should be reauthorized to meet those needs  housing  for the past 14 months high interest rates have had a severe impact on the nations housing market yet the current pressures and uncertainties should not obscure the achievements of the past four years  working with the congress the regulatory agencies and the financial community my administration has brought about an expanded and steadier flow of funds into home mortgages deregulation of the interest rates payable by depository institutions the evolution of variable and renegotiated rate mortgages development of high yielding savings certificates and expansion of the secondary mortgage market have all increased housings ability to attract capital and have assured that mortgage money would not be cut off when interest rates rose these actions will diminish the cyclicality of the housing industry further we have secured legislation updating the federal governments emergency authority to provide support for the housing industry through the brookecranston program and creating a new section 235 housing stimulus program these tools will enable the federal government to deal quickly and effectively with serious distress in this critical industry  we have also worked to expand homeownership opportunities for americans by using innovative financing mechanisms such as the graduated payment mortgage we have increased the access of middle income families to housing credit by revitalizing the section 235 program we have enabled nearly 100000 moderate income households to purchase new homes by reducing paperwork and regulation in federal programs and by working with state and local governments to ease the regulatory burden we have helped to hold down housing costs and produce affordable housing  as a result of these governmentwide efforts 5 12 million more american families bought homes in the past four years than in any equivalent period in history and more than 7 million homes have begun construction during my administration 1 million more than in the previous four years  we have devoted particular effort to meeting the housing needs of low and moderate income families in the past four years more than 1 million subsidized units have been made available for occupancy by lower income americans and more than 600000 assisted units have gone into construction in addition we have undertaken a series of measures to revitalize and preserve the nations 2 million units of public and assisted housing  for fiscal year 1982 i am proposing to continue our commitment to lower income housing i am requesting funds to support 260000 units of section 8 and public housing maintaining these programs at the level provided by congress in fiscal 1981  while we have made progress in the past four years in the future there are reasons for concern home price inflation and high interest rates threaten to put homeownership out of reach for firsttime homebuyers lower income households the elderly and those dependent upon rental housing face rising rents low levels of rental housing construction by historic standards and the threat of displacement due to conversion to condominiums and other factors housing will face strong competition for investment capital from the industrial sector generally and the energy industries in particular  to address these issues i appointed a presidential task force and advisory group last october while this effort will not proceed due to the election result i hope the incoming administration will proceed with a similar venture  the most important action government can take to meet americas housing needs is to restore stability to the economy and bring down the rate of inflation inflation has driven up home prices operating costs and interest rates market uncertainty about inflation has contributed to the instability in interest rates which has been an added burden to homebuilders and homebuyers alike by making a longterm commitment to provide a framework for greater investment sustained economic growth and price stability my administration has begun the work of creating a healthy environment for housing  transportation  with the passage of the airline deregulation act of 1978 the motor carrier act of 1980 and the harley o staggers rail act of 1980 my administration working with the congress has initiated a new era of reduced regulation of transportation industries deregulation will lead to increased productivity and operating efficiencies in the industries involved and stimulate price and service competition to the benefit of consumers generally i urge the new administration to continue our efforts on behalf of deregulation legislation for the intercity passenger bus industry as well  in the coming decade the most significant challenge facing the nation in transportation services will be to improve a deteriorating physical infrastructure of roadways railroads waterways and mass transit systems in order to conserve costly energy supplies while promoting effective transportation services  highways  our vast network of highways which account for 90 percent of travel and 80 percent by value of freight traffic goods movement is deteriorating if current trends continue a major proportion of the interstate pavement will have deteriorated by the end of the 1980s  arresting the deterioration of the nations system of highways is a high priority objective for the 1980s we must reorient the federal mission from major new construction projects to the stewardship of the existing interstate highway system interstate gaps should be judged on the connections they make and on their compatibility with community needs  during this decade highway investments will be needed to increase productivity particularly in the elimination of bottlenecks provide more efficient connections to ports and seek lowcost solutions to traffic demand  my administration has therefore recommended redefining completion of the interstate system consolidating over 27 categorical assistance programs into nine and initiating a major repair and rehabilitation program for segments of the interstate system this effort should help maintain the condition and performance of the nations highways particularly the interstate and primary system provide a realistic means to complete the interstate system by 1990 ensure better program delivery through consolidation and assist urban revitalization in addition the congress must address the urgent funding problems of the highway trust fund and the need to generate greater revenues  mass transit  in the past decade the nations public transit systems ridership increased at an annual average of 11 each year in the 1970s 69 in 1979 continued increases in the cost of fuel are expected to make transit a growing part of the nations transportation system  as a result my administration projected a ten year 43 billion program to increase mass transit capacity by 50 percent and promote more energy efficient vehicle uses in the next decade the first part of this proposal was the five year 247 billion urban mass transportation administration reauthorization legislation i sent to the congress in march 1980 i urge the 97th congress to quickly enact this or similar legislation in 1981  my administration was also the first to have proposed and signed into law a nonurban formula grant program to assist rural areas and small communities with public transportation programs to end their dependence on the automobile promote energy conservation and efficiency and provide transportation services to impoverished rural communities  a principal need of the 1980s will be maintaining mobility for all segments of the population in the face of severely increasing transportation costs and uncertainty of fuel supplies we must improve the flexibility of our transportation system and offer greater choice and diversity in transportation services while the private automobile will continue to be the principal means of transportation for many americans public transportation can become an increasingly attractive alternative we therefore want to explore a variety of paratransit modes various types of buses modern rapid transit regional rail systems and light rail systems  highway planning and transit planning must be integrated and related to state regional district and neighborhood planning efforts now in place or emerging low density development and land use threaten the fiscal capacity of many communities to support needed services and infrastructure  elderly and handicapped transportation  transportation policies in the 1980s must pay increasing attention to the needs of the elderly and handicapped by 1990 the number of people over 65 will have grown from todays 19 million to 27 million during the same period the number of handicappedpeople who have difficulty using transit as well as autos including the elderlyis expected to increase from 9 to 11 million making up 45 percent of the population  we must not retreat from a policy that affords a significant and growing portion of our population accessible public transportation while recognizing that the handicapped are a diverse group and will need flexible doortodoor service where regular public transportation will not do the job  railroads  in addition the federal government must reassess the appropriate federal role of support for passenger and freight rail services such as amtrak and conrail our goal through federal assistance should be to maintain and enhance adequate rail service where it is not otherwise available to needy communities but federal subsidies must be closely scrutinized to be sure they are a stimulus to and not a replacement for private investment and initiative federal assistance cannot mean permanent subsidies for unprofitable operations  waterways and rural transportation  there is a growing need in rural and small communities for improved transportation services rail freight service to many communities has declined as railroads abandon unproductive branch lines at the same time rural roads are often inadequate to handle large heavilyloaded trucks the increased demand for harvest to harbor service has also placed an increased burden on rural transportation systems while bottlenecks along the mississippi river delay grain shipments to the gulf of mexico  we have made some progress  to further develop the nations waterways my administration began construction of a new 1200 foot lock at the site of lock and dam 26 on the mississippi river when opened in 1987 the new lock will have a capacity of 86 million tons per year an 18 percent increase over the present system the us army corps of engineers has also undertaken studies to assess the feasibility of expanding the bonneville locks rehabilitation of john day lock was begun in 1980 and should be completed in 1982 my administration also supports the completion of the upper mississippi river master plan to determine the feasibility of constructing a second lock at alton illinois these efforts will help alleviate delays in transporting corn soybeans and other goods along the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico  the department of transportations new small community and rural transportation policy will target federal assistance for passenger transportation roads and highways truck service and railroad freight service to rural areas this policy implements and expands upon the earlier white house initiative improving transportation in rural america announced in june 1979 and the presidents small community and rural development policy announced in december 1979 the congress should seek ways to balance rail branch line abandonment with the service needs of rural and farm communities provide financial assistance to rail branch line rehabilitation where appropriate assist shippers to adjust to rail branch line abandonment where it takes place and help make it possible for trucking firms to serve light density markets with dependable and efficient trucking services  maritime policy  during my administration i have sought to ensure that the us maritime industry will not have to function at an unfair competitive disadvantage in the international market as i indicated in my maritime policy statement to the congress in july 1979 the american merchant marine is vital to our nations welfare and federal actions should promote rather than harm it in pursuit of this objective i signed into law the controlled carrier act of 1978 authorizing the federal maritime commission to regulate certain rate cutting practices of some statecontrolled carriers and recently signed a bilateral maritime agreement with the peoples republic of china that will expand the access of american ships to 20 specified chinese ports and set aside for americanflag ships a substantial share at least onethird of the cargo between our countries this agreement should officially foster expanded us and chinese shipping services linking the two countries and will provide further momentum to the growth of sinoamerican trade  there is also a need to modernize and expand the dry bulk segment of our fleet our heavy dependence on foreign carriage of usbulk cargoes deprives the us economy of seafaring and shipbuilding jobs adds to the balanceofpayments deficit deprives the government of substantial tax revenues and leaves the united states dependent on foreignflag shipping for a continued supply of raw materials to support the civil economy and war production in time of war  i therefore sent to the congress proposed legislation to strengthen this woefully weak segment of the usflag fleet by removing certain disincentives to us construction of dry bulkers and their operation under us registry enactment of this proposed legislation would establish the basis for accelerating the rebuilding of the usflag dry bulk fleet toward a level commensurate with the position of the united states as the worlds leading bulk trading country  during the past year the administration has stated its support for legislation that would provide specific federal assistance for the installation of fuelefficient engines in existing american ships and would strengthen this countrys shipbuilding mobilization base strengthening the fleet is important but we must also maintain our shipbuilding base for future ship construction  provisions in existing laws calling for substantial or exclusive use of americanflag vessels to carry cargoes generated by the government must be vigorously pursued  i have therefore supported requirements that 50 percent of oil purchased for the strategic petroleum reserve be transported in usflag vessels that the cargo preference act be applied to materials furnished for the us assisted construction of air bases in israel and to cargoes transported pursuant to the chrysler corporation loan guarantee act in addition the deep seabed hard mineral resources act requires that at least one ore carrier per mine site be a usflag vessel  much has been done and much remains to be done the fy 1982 budget includes a 107 million authorization for construction differential subsidy cds funds which added to the unobligated cds balance of 100 million from 1980 and the recently enacted 135 million 1981 authorization will provide an average of 171 million in cds funds in 1981 and 1982  coal export policy  while significant growth in foreign demand for us steam coal is foreseen congestion at major us coal exporting ports such as hampton roads virginia and baltimore maryland could delay and impede exports  my administration has worked through the interagency coal task force study which i created to promote cooperation and coordination of resources between shippers railroads vessel broker operators and port operators and to determine the most appropriate federal role in expanding and modernizing coal export facilities including dredging deeper channels at selected ports  some progress has already been made in addition to action taken by transshippers to reduce the number of coal classifications used whenever possible by the norfolk and western railroad to upgrade its computer capability to quickly inventory its coal cars in its yards and by the chessie railroad which is reactivating pier 15 in newport news and has established a berth near its curtis bay pier in baltimore to decrease delays in vessel berthing public activities will include  a 265 million plan developed by the state of pennsylvania and conrail to increase conrails coal handling capacity at philadelphia  a proposal by the state of virginia to construct a steam coal port on the craney island disposal area in portsmouth harbor  plans by mobile alabama which operates the only publicly owned coal terminal in the us to enlarge its capacity at mcduffie island to 10 million tons ground storage and 100 car unit train unloading capability  development at new orleans of steam coal facilities that are expected to add over 20 million tons of annual capacity by 1983 and  the corps of engineers working with other interested federal agencies will determine which ports should be dredged to what depth and on what schedule in order to accommodate larger coal carrying vessels  private industry will of course play a major role in developing the united states coal export facilities the new administration should continue to work to eliminate transportation bottlenecks that impede our access to foreign markets  special needs  women  the past four years have been years of rapid advancement for women our focus has been twofold to provide american women with a full range of opportunities and to make them a part of the mainstream of every aspect of our national life and leadership  i have appointed a record number of women to judgeships and to top government posts fully 22 percent of all my appointees are women and i nominated 41 of the 46 women who sit on the federal bench today for the first time in our history women occupy policymaking positions at the highest level of every federal agency and department and have demonstrated their ability to serve our citizens well  we have strengthened the rights of employed women by consolidating and strengthening enforcement of sex discrimination laws under the eeoc by expanding employment rights of pregnant women through the pregnancy disability bill and by increasing federal employment opportunities for women through civil service reform and flexitime and parttime employment  by executive order i created the first national program to provide women businessowners with technical assistance grants loans and improved access to federal contracts  we have been sensitive to the needs of women who are homemakers i established an office of families within hhs and sponsored the white house conference on families we initiated a program targeting ceta funds to help displaced homemakers the social security system was amended to eliminate the widows penalty and a comprehensive study of discriminatory provisions and possible changes was presented to congress legislation was passed to give divorced spouses of foreign service officers rights to share in pension benefits  we created an office on domestic violence within hhs to coordinate the 12 agencies that now have domestic violence relief programs and to distribute information on the problem and the services available to victims  despite a stringent budget for fy 1981 the administration consistently supported the womens educational equity act and family planning activities as well as other programs that affect women such as food stamps wic and social security  we have been concerned not only about the american womans opportunities but ensuring equality for women around the world in november 1980 i sent to the senate the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women this united nations document is the most comprehensive and detailed international agreement which seeks the advancement of women  on womens issues i have sought the counsel of men and women in and out of government and from all regions of our country i established two panels the presidents advisory committee for women and the interdepartmental task force on womento advise me on these issues the mandate for both groups expired on december 31 but they have left behind a comprehensive review of the status of women in our society today that review provides excellent guidance for the work remaining in our battle against sex discrimination  even though we have made progress much remains on the agenda for women i remain committed to the equal rights amendment and will continue to work for its passage it is essential to the goal of bringing americas women fully into the mainstream of american life that the era be ratified  the efforts begun for women in employment business and education should be continued and strengthened money should be available to states to establish programs to help the victims of domestic violence congress should pass a national health care plan and a welfare reform program and these measures should reflect the needs of women  the talents of women should continue to be used to the fullest inside and outside of government and efforts should continue to see that they have the widest range of opportunities and options  handicapped  i hope that my administration will be remembered in this area for leading the way toward full civil rights for handicapped americans when i took office no federal agency had yet issued 504 regulations as i leave office this first step by every major agency and department in the federal government is almost complete but it is only a first step the years ahead will require steadfast dedication by the president to protect and promote these precious rights in the classroom in the workplace and in all public facilities so that handicapped individuals may join the american mainstream and contribute to the fullest their resources and talents to our economic and social life  just as we supported in an unprecedented way the civil rights of disabled persons in schools and in the workplace other initiatives in health prevention such as our immunization and nutrition programs for young children and new intense efforts to reverse spinal cord injury must continue so that the incidence of disability continues to decline  this year is the undeclared international year of disabled persons we are organizing activities to celebrate and promote this important commemorative year within the government as well as in cooperation with private sector efforts in this country and around the world the international year will give our country the opportunity to recognize the talents and capabilities of our fellow citizens with disabilities we can also share our rehabilitation and treatment skills with other countries and learn from them as well i am proud that the united states leads the world in mainstreaming and treating disabled people however we have a long way to go before all psychological and physical barriers to disabled people are torn down and they can be full participants in our american way of life we must pledge our full commitment to this goal during the international year  families  because of my concern for american families my administration convened last year the first white house conference on families which involved seven national hearings over 506 state and local events three white house conferences and the direct participation of more than 125000 citizens the conference reaffirmed the centrality of families in our lives and nation but documented problems american families face as well we also established the office of families within the department of health and human services to review government policies and programs that affect families  i expect the departments and agencies within the executive branch of the federal government as well as members of congress corporate and business leaders and state and local officials across the country to study closely the recommendations of the white house conference and implement them appropriately as public policy is developed and implemented by the federal government cognizance of the work of the conference should be taken as a pragmatic and essential step  the conference has done a good job of establishing an agenda for action to assure that the policies of the federal government are more sensitive in their impact on families i hope the congress will review and seriously consider the conferences recommendations  older americans  my administration has taken great strides toward solving the difficult problems faced by older americans early in my term we worked successfully with the congress to assure adequate revenues for the social security trust funds and last year the strength of the social security system was strengthened by legislation i proposed to permit borrowing among the separate trust funds i have also signed into law legislation prohibiting employers from requiring retirement prior to age 70 and removing mandatory retirement for most federal employees in addition my administration worked very closely with congress to amend the older americans act in a way that has already improved administration of its housing social services food delivery and employment programs  this year i will be submitting to congress a budget which again demonstrates my commitment to programs for the elderly it will include as my previous budgets have increased funding for nutrition senior centers and home health care and will focus added resources on the needs of older americans  with the 1981 white house conference on aging approaching i hope the new administration will make every effort to assure an effective and useful conference this conference should enable older americans to voice their concerns and give us guidance in our continued efforts to ensure the quality of life so richly deserved by our senior citizens  refugees  we cannot hope to build a just and humane society at home if we ignore the humanitarian claims of refugees their lives at stake who have nowhere else to turn our country can be proud that hundreds of thousands of people around the world would risk everything they haveincluding their own livesto come to our country  this administration initiated and implemented the first comprehensive reform of our refugee and immigration policies in over 25 years we also established the first refugee coordination office in the department of state under the leadership of a special ambassador and coordinator for refugee affairs and programs the new legislation and the coordinators office will bring common sense and consolidation to our nations previously fragmented inconsistent and in many ways outdated refugee and immigration policies  with the unexpected arrival of thousands of cubans and haitians who sought refuge in our country last year outside of our regular immigration and refugee admissions process our country and its government were tested in being compassionate and responsive to a major human emergency because we had taken steps to reorganize our refugee programs we met that test successfully i am proud that the american people responded to this crisis with their traditional good will and hospitality also we would never have been able to handle this unprecedented emergency without the efforts of the private resettlement agencies who have always been there to help refugees in crises  immigrants to this country always contribute more toward making our country stronger than they ever take from the system i am confident that the newest arrivals to our country will carry on this tradition  while we must remain committed to aiding and assisting those who come to our shores at the same time we must uphold our immigration and refugee policies and provide adequate enforcement resources as a result of our enforcement policy the illegal flow from cuba has been halted and an orderly process has been initiated to make certain that our refugee and immigration laws are honored  this year the select commission on immigration and refugee policy will complete its work and forward its advice and recommendations i hope that the recommendations will be carefully considered by the new administration and the congress for it is clear that we must take additional action to keep our immigration policy responsive to emergencies and ever changing times  veterans  this country and its leadership has a continuing and unique obligation to the men and women who served their nation in the armed forces and help maintain or restore peace in the world  my commitment to veterans as evidenced by my record is characterized by a conscientious and consistent emphasis in these general areas  first we have worked to honor the vietnam veteran during my administration and under the leadership of va administrator max cleland i was proud to lead our country in an overdue acknowledgement of our nations gratitude to the men and women who served their country during the bitter war in southeast asia their homecoming was deferred and seemed doomed to be ignored our country has matured in the last four years and at long last we were able to separate the war from the warrior and honor these veterans but with our acknowledgement of their service goes an understanding that some vietnam veterans have unique needs and problems  my administration was able to launch a long sought after psychological readjustment and outreach program unprecedented in its popularity sensitivity and success this program must be continued the administration has also grappled with the difficult questions posed by some veterans who served in southeast asia and were exposed to potentially harmful substances including the herbicide known as agent orange we have launched scientific inquiries that should answer many veterans questions about their health and should provide the basis for establishing sound compensation policy we cannot rest until their concerns are dealt with in a sensitive expeditious and compassionate fashion  second we have focused the va health care system in the needs of the serviceconnected disabled veteran we initiated and are implementing the first reform of the va vocational rehabilitation system since its inception in 1943 also my administration was the first to seek a costofliving increase for the recipients of va compensation every year my last budget also makes such a request the administration also launched the disabled veterans outreach program in the department of labor which has successfully placed disabled veterans in jobs services provided by the va health care system will be further targeted to the special needs of disabled veterans during the coming year  third the va health care system the largest in the free world has maintained its independence and high quality during my administration we have made the system more efficient and have therefore treated more veterans than ever before by concentrating on outpatient care and through modern management improvements as the median age of the american veteran population increases we must concentrate on further changes within the va system to keep it independent and to serve as a model to the nation and to the world as a center for research treatment and rehabilitation  government assistance  general aid to state and local governments  since taking office i have been strongly committed to strengthening the fiscal and economic condition of our nations state and local governments i have accomplished this goal by encouraging economic development of local communities and by supporting the general revenue sharing and other essential grantinaid programs  grantsinaid to states and localities  during my administration total grantsinaid to state and local governments have increased by more than 40 percent from 68 billion in fiscal year 1977 to 96 billion in fiscal year 1981 this significant increase in aid has allowed states and localities to maintain services that are essential to their citizens without imposing onerous tax burdens it also has allowed us to establish an unprecedented partnership between the leaders of the federal government and state and local government elected officials  general revenue sharing  last year congress enacted legislation that extends the general revenue sharing program for three more years this program is the cornerstone of our efforts to maintain the fiscal health of our nations local government it will provide 46 billion in each of the next three years to cities counties and towns this program is essential to the continued ability of our local governments to provide essential police fire and sanitation services  this legislation renewing grs will be the cornerstone of federalstatelocal government relations in the 1980s this policy will emphasize the need for all levels of government to cooperate in order to meet the needs of the most fiscally strained cities and counties and also will emphasize the important role that grs can play in forging this partnership i am grateful that congress moved quickly to assure that our nations localities can begin the 1980s in sound fiscal condition  countercyclical assistance  last year i proposed that congress enact a 1 billion countercyclical fiscal assistance program to protect states and localities from unexpected changes in the national economy this program unfortunately was not enacted by the full congress i therefore have not included funding for countercyclical aid in my fiscal year 1982 budget nevertheless i urge congress to enact a permanent standby countercyclical program so that states and cities can be protected during the next economic downturn  urban policy  three years ago i proposed the nations first comprehensive urban policy that policy involved more than one hundred improvements in existing federal programs four new executive orders and nineteen pieces of urbanoriented legislation with congress cooperation sixteen of these bills have now been signed into law  economic development  one of the principal goals of my domestic policy has been to strengthen the private sector economic base of our nations economically troubled urban and rural areas with congress cooperation we have substantially expanded the federal governments economic development programs and provided new tax incentives for private investment in urban and rural communities these programs have helped many communities to attract new private sector jobs and investments and to retain the jobs and investments that already are in place  when i took office the federal government was spending less than 300 million annually on economic development programs and only 60 million of those funds in our nations urban areas since that time we have created the urban development action grant udag program and substantially expanded the economic development programs in the commerce department my fy 1982 budget requests more than 15 billion for economic development grants loans and interest subsidies and almost 15 billion for loan guarantees approximately 60 percent of these funds will be spent in our nations urban areas in addition we have extended the 10 percent investment credit to include rehabilitation of existing industrial facilities as well as new construction  i continue to believe that the development of private sector investment and jobs is the key to revitalizing our nations economically depressed urban and rural areas to ensure that the necessary economic development goes forward the congress must continue to provide strong support for the udag program and the programs for the economic development administration those programs provide a foundation for the economic development of our nation in the 1980s  community development  the partnership among federal state and local governments to revitalize our nations communities has been a high priority of my administration when i took office i proposed a substantial expansion of the community development block grant cdbg program and the enactment of a new 400 million urban development action grant udag program both of these programs have provided essential community and economic development assistance to our nations cities and counties  last year congress reauthorized both the cdbg and udag programs the cdbg program was reauthorized for three more years with annual funding increases of 150 million and the udag program was extended for three years at the current funding level of 675 million annually my 1982 budget requests full funding for both of these programs these actions should help our nations cities and counties to continue the progress they have made in the last three years  neighborhoods  during my administration we have taken numerous positive steps to achieve a full partnership of neighborhood organizations and government at all levels we have successfully fought against red lining and housing discrimination we created innovative self help funding and technical resource transfer mechanisms we have created unique methods of access for neighborhood organizations to have a participating role in federal and state government decisionmaking neighborhood based organizations are the threshold of the american community  the federal government will need to develop more innovative and practical ways for neighborhood based organizations to successfully participate in the identification and solution of local and neighborhood concerns full partnership will only be achieved with the knowing participation of leaders of government business education and unions neither state nor federal solutions imposed from on high will suffice neighborhoods are the fabric and soul of this great land neighborhoods define the weave that has been used to create a permanent fabric the federal government must take every opportunity to provide access and influence to the individuals and organizations affected at the neighborhood level  rural policy  since the beginning of my administration i have been committed to improving the effectiveness with which the federal government deals with the problems and needs of a rapidly changing rural america the rapid growth of some rural areas has placed a heavy strain on communities and their resources there are also persistent problems of poverty and economic stagnation in other parts of rural america some rural areas continue to lose population as they have for the past several decades  in december 1979 i announced the small community and rural development policy it was the culmination of several years work and was designed to address the varying needs of our rural population in 1980 my administration worked with the congress to pass the rural development policy act of 1980 which when fully implemented will allow us to meet the needs of rural people and their communities more effectively and more efficiently  as a result of the policy and the accompanying legislation we have  created the position of under secretary of agriculture for small community and rural development to provide overall leadership  established a white house working group to assist in the implementation of the policy  worked with more than 40 governors to form state rural development councils to work in partnership with the white house working group and the federal agencies to better deliver state and federal programs to rural areas  directed the white house working group to annually review existing and proposed policies programs and budget levels to determine their adequacy in meeting rural needs and the fulfilling of the policys objectives and principles  this effort on the part of my administration and the congress has resulted in a landmark policy for the first time rural affairs has received the prominence it has always deserved it is a policy that can truly help alleviate the diverse and differing problems rural america will face in the 1980s  with the help and dedication of a great many people around the country who are concerned with rural affairs we have constructed a mechanism for dealing effectively with rural problems there is now a great opportunity to successfully combine federal efforts with the efforts of rural community leaders and residents it is my hope this spirit of cooperation and record of accomplishment will be continued in the coming years  consumers  in september 1979 i signed an executive order designed to strengthen and coordinate federal consumer programs and to establish procedures to improve and facilitate consumer participation in government decisionmaking forty federal agencies have adopted programs to comply with the requirements of the order these programs will improve complaint handling provide better information to consumers enhance opportunities for public participation in government proceedings and assure that the consumer point of view is considered in all programs policies and regulations  while substantial progress has been made in assuring a consumer presence in federal agencies work must continue to meet fully the goals of the executive order close monitoring of agency compliance with the requirements of the order is necessary continued evaluation to assure that the programs are effective and making maximum use of available resources is also essential as a complement to these initiatives efforts to provide financial assistance in regulatory proceedings to citizen groups small businesses and others whose participation is limited by their economic circumstances must continue to be pursued  it is essential that consumer representatives in government pay particular attention to the needs and interests of lowincome consumers and minorities the office of consumer affairs publication people power what communities are doing to counter inflation catalogues some of the ways that government and the private sector can assist the less powerful in our society to help themselves new ways should be found to help foster this new peoples movement which is founded on the principle of selfreliance  science and technology  science and technology contribute immeasurably to the lives of all americans our high standard of living is largely the product of the technology that surrounds us in the home or factory our good health is due in large part to our ever increasing scientific understanding our national security is assured by the application pate science and technology will bring  the federal government has a special role to play in science and technology although the fruits of scientific achievements surround us it is often difficult to predict the benefits that will arise from a given scientific venture and these benefits even if predictable do not usually lead to ownership rights accordingly the government has a special obligation to support science as an investment in our future  my administration has sought to reverse a decadelong decline in funding despite the need for fiscal restraint real support of basic research has grown nearly 11 during my term in office and my administration has sought to increase the support of longterm research in the variety of mission agencies in this way we can harness the american genius for innovation to meet the economic energy health and security challenges that confront our nation  international relations and national security science and technology are becoming increasingly important elements of our national security and foreign policies this is especially so in the current age of sophisticated defense systems and of growing dependence among all countries on modern technology for all aspects of their economic strength for these reasons scientific and technological considerations have been integral elements of the administrations decisionmaking on such national security and foreign policy issues as the modernization of our strategic weaponry arms control technology transfer the growing bilateral relationship with china and our relations with the developing world  four themes have shaped us policy in international scientific and technological cooperation pursuit of new international initiatives to advance our own research and development objectives development and strengthening of scientific exchange to bridge politically ideological and cultural divisions between this country and other countries formulation of programs and institutional relations to help developing countries use science and technology beneficially and cooperation with other nations to manage technologies with local impact at my direction my science and technology adviser has actively pursued international programs in support of these four themes we have given special attention to scientific and technical relations with china to new forms of scientific and technical cooperation with japan to cooperation with mexico other latin american and caribbean countries and several states in black america and to the proposed institute for scientific and technological cooperation  in particular our cooperation with developing countries reflects the importance that each of them has placed on the relationship between economic growth and scientific and technological capability it also reflects their view that the great strength of the us in science and technology makes close relations with the us technical community an especially productive means of enhancing this capability scientific and technological assistance is a key linkage between the us and the developing world a linkage that has been underutilized in the past and one which we must continue to work to strengthen  space policy the administration has established a framework for a strong and evolving space program for the 1980s  the administrations space policy reaffirmed the separation of military space systems and the open civil space program and at the same time provided new guidance on technology transfer between the civil and military programs the civil space program centers on three basic tenets first our space policy will reflect a balanced strategy of applications science and technology development second activities will be pursued when they can be uniquely or more efficiently accomplished in space third a premature commitment to a high challenge spaceengineering initiative of the complexity of apollo is inappropriate as the shuttle development phases down however there will be added flexibility to consider new space applications space science and new space exploration activities  technology development the shuttle dominates our technology development effort and correctly so it represents one of the most sophisticated technological challenges ever undertaken and as a result has encountered technical problems nonetheless the first manned orbital flight is now scheduled for march 1981 i have been pleased to support strongly the necessary funds for the shuttle throughout my administration  space applications since 1972 the us has conducted experimental civil remote sensing through landsat satellites thereby realizing many successful applications recognizing this fact i directed the implementation of an operational civil land satellite remote sensing system with the operational management responsibility in commerces national oceanic and atmospheric administration in addition because ocean observations from space can meet common civil and military data requirements a national oceanic satellite system has been proposed as a major fy 1981 new start  space science exploration the goals of this administrations policy in space science have been to 1 continue a vigorous program of planetary exploration to understand the origin and evolution of the solar system 2 utilize the space telescope and freeflying satellites to usher in a new era of astronomy 3 develop a better understanding of the sun and its interaction with the terrestrial environment and 4 utilize the shuttle and spacelab to conduct basic research that complements earthbased life science investigations  district of columbia  washington dc is home to both the federal government and to more than half a million american citizens i have worked to improve the relationship between the federal establishment and the government of the district of columbia in order to further the goals and spirit of home rule the city controls more of its own destiny than was the case four years ago yet despite the close cooperation between my administration and that of mayor barry we have not yet seen the necessary number of states ratify the constitutional amendment granting full voting representation in the congress to the citizens of this city it is my hope that this inequity will be rectified the country and the people who inhabit washington deserve no less  the arts  the arts are a precious national resource  federal support for the arts has been enhanced during my administration by expanding government funding and services to arts institutions individual artists scholars and teachers through the national endowment for the arts we have broadened its scope and reach to a more diverse population we have also reactivated the federal council on the arts and humanities  it is my hope that during the coming years the new administration and the congress will  continue support of institutions promoting development and understanding of the arts  encourage business participants in a comprehensive effort to achieve a truly mixed economy of support for the arts  explore a variety of mechanisms to nurture the creative talent of our citizens and build audiences for their work  support strong active national endowments for the arts  seek greater recognition for the rich cultural tradition of the nations minorities  provide grants for the arts in lowincome neighborhoods  the humanities  in recently reauthorizing federal appropriations for the national endowment for the humanities the congress has once again reaffirmed that the encouragement and support of national progress and scholarship in the humanities    while primarily a matter for private and local initiative is also an appropriate matter of concern to the federal government and that a high civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone but must give full value and support to the other great branches of mans scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past a better analysis of the present and a better view of the future  i believe we are in agreement that the humanities illuminate the values underlying important personal social and national questions raised in our society by its multiple links to and increasing dependence on technology and by the diverse heritage of our many regions and ethnic groups the humanities cast light on the broad issue of the role in a society of men and women of imagination and energythose individuals who through their own example define the spirit of the age and in so doing move nations our governments support for the humanities within the framework laid down by the congress is a recognition of their essential nourishment of the life of the mind and vital enrichment of our national life  i will be proposing an increase in funding this year sufficient to enable the endowment to maintain the same level of support offered our citizens in fiscal year 1981  in the allocation of this funding special emphasis will be given to  humanities education in the nations schools in response to the great needs that have arisen in this area  scholarly research designed to increase our understanding of the cultures traditions and historical forces at work in other nations and in our own  drawing attention to the physical disintegration of the raw material of our cultural heritagebooks manuscripts periodicals and other documentsand to the development of techniques to prevent the destruction and to preserve those materials and  the dissemination of quality programming in the humanities to increasingly large american audiences through the use of radio and television  the dominant effort in the endowments expenditures will be a commitment to strengthen and promulgate scholarly excellence and achievement in work in the humanities in our schools colleges universities libraries museums and other cultural institutions as well as in the work of individual scholars or collaborative groups engaged in advanced research in the humanities  in making its grants the endowment will increase its emphasis on techniques which stimulate support for the humanities from nonfederal sources in order to reinforce our tradition of private philanthropy in this field and to insure and expand the financial viability of our cultural institutions and life  insular areas  i have been firmly committed to selfdetermination for puerto rico the virgin islands guam american samoa and the northern mariana islands and have vigorously supported the realization of whatever political status aspirations are democratically chosen by their peoples this principle was the keystone of the comprehensive territorial policy i sent the congress last year i am pleased that most of the legislative elements of that policy were endorsed by the 96th congress  the unique cultures fragile economies and locations of our caribbean and pacific islands are distinct assets to the united states which require the sensitive application of policy the united states government should pursue initiatives begun by my administration and the congress to stimulate insular economic development enhance treatment under federal programs eliminating current inequities provide vitally needed special assistance and coordinate and rationalize policies these measures will result in greater selfsufficiency and balanced growth in particular i hope that the new congress will support funding for fiscal management comprehensive planning and other technical assistance for the territories as well as create the commission i have proposed to review the applicability of all federal laws to the insular areas and make recommendations for appropriate modification  iv removing governmental waste and inefficiency  one of my major commitments has been to restore public faith in our federal government by cutting out waste and inefficiency in the past four years we have made dramatic advances toward this goal many of them previously considered impossible to achieve where government rules and operations were unnecessary they have been eliminated as with airline rail trucking and financial deregulation where government functions are needed they have been streamlined through such landmark measures as the civil service reform act of 1978 i hope that the new administration and the congress will keep up the momentum we have established for effective and responsible change in this area of crucial public concern  civil service reform  in march 1978 i submitted the civil service reform act to congress i called it the centerpiece of my efforts to reform and reorganize the government with bipartisan support from congress the bill passed and i am pleased to say that implementation is running well ahead of the statutory schedule throughout the service we are putting into place the means to assure that reward and retention are based on performance and not simply on length of time on the job in the first real test of the reform act 98 percent of the eligible toplevel managers joined the senior executive service choosing to relinquish job protections for the challenge and potential reward of this new corps of top executives though the act does not require several of its key elements to be in operation for another year some federal agencies already have established merit pay systems for gs1315 managers and most agencies are well on their way to establishing new performance standards for all their employees all have paid out or are now in the process of paying out performance bonuses earned by outstanding members of the senior executive service dismissals have increased by 10 percent and dismissals specifically for inadequate job performance have risen 1500 percent since the act was adopted finally we have established a fully independent merit systems protection board and special counsel to protect the rights of whistleblowers and other federal employees faced with threats to their rights  in 1981 civil service reform faces critical challenges all agencies must have fully functioning performance appraisal systems for all employees and merit pay systems for compensating the governments 130000 gs1315 managers performance bonuses for members of the senior executive service will surely receive scrutiny if this attention is balanced and constructive it can only enhance the chances for ultimate success of our bipartisan commitment to the revolutionary and crucial pay for performance concept  regulatory reform  during the past four years we have made tremendous progress in regulatory reform we have discarded old economic regulations that prevented competition and raised consumer costs and we have imposed strong management principles on the regulatory programs the country needs cutting paperwork and other wasteful burdens the challenge for the future is to continue the progress in both areas without crippling vital health and safety programs  our economic deregulation program has achieved major successes in five areas  airlines the airline deregulation act is generating healthy competition saving billions in fares and making the airlines more efficient the act provides that in 1985 the cab itself will go out of existence  trucking the trucking deregulation bill opens the industry to competition and allows truckers wide latitude on the routes they drive and the goods they haul the bill also phases out most of the old laws immunity for setting rates the congressional budget office estimates these reforms will save as much as 8 billion per year and cut as much as half a percentage point from the inflation rate  railroads overregulation has stifled railroad management initiative service and competitive pricing the new legislation gives the railroads the freedom they need to rebuild a strong efficient railroad industry  financial institutions with the help of the congress over the past four years we have achieved two major pieces of financial reform legislation legislation which has provided the basis for the most farreaching changes in the financial services industry since the 1930s the international banking act of 1978 was designed to reduce the advantages that foreign banks operating in the united states possessed in comparison to domestic banks the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act adopted last march provides for the phased elimination of a variety of anticompetitive barriers to financial institutions and freedom to offer services to and attract the savings of consumers especially small savers  recently i submitted to the congress my administrations recommendations for the phased liberalization of restrictions on geographic expansion by commercial banks last year the administration and financial regulatory agencies proposed legislation to permit the interstate acquisition of failing depository institutions in view of the difficult outlook for some depository institutions i strongly urge the congress to take prompt favorable action on the failing bank legislation  telecommunications while congress did not pass legislation in this area the federal communications commission has taken dramatic action to open all aspects of communications to competition and to eliminate regulations in the areas where competition made them obsolete the public is benefitting from an explosion of competition and new services  while these initiatives represent dramatic progress in economic deregulation continued work is needed i urge congress to act on communications legislation and to consider other proposed deregulation measures such as legislation on the bus industry in addition the regulatory commissions must maintain their commitment to competition as the best regulator of all  the other part of my reform program covers the regulations that are needed to protect the health safety and welfare of our citizens for these regulations my administration has created a management program to cut costs without sacrificing goals under my executive order 12044 we required agencies to analyze the costs of their major new rules and consider alternative approaches such as performance standards and voluntary codes that may make rules less costly and more flexible we created the regulatory analysis review group in the white house to analyze the most costly proposed new rules and find ways to improve them the regulatory council was established to provide the first governmentwide listing of upcoming rules and eliminate overlapping and conflicting regulations agencies have launched sunset programs to weed out outmoded old regulations we have acted to encourage public participation in regulatory decisionmaking  these steps have already saved billions of dollars in regulatory costs and slashed thousands of outmoded regulations we are moving steadily toward a regulatory system that provides needed protections fairly predictably and at minimum cost  i urge congress to continue on this steady path and resist the simplistic solutions that have been proposed as alternatives proposals like legislative veto and increased judicial review will add another layer to the regulatory process making it more cumbersome and inefficient the right approach to reform is to improve the individual statutes where they need change and to ensure that the regulatory agencies implement those statutes sensibly  paperwork reduction  the federal government imposes a huge paperwork burden on business local government and the private sector many of these forms are needed for vital government functions but others are duplicative overly complex or obsolete  during my administration we cut the paperwork burden by 15 percent and we created procedures to continue this progress the new paperwork reduction act centralizes in omb oversight of all agencies information requirements and strengthens ombs authority to eliminate needless forms the paperwork budget process which i established by executive order applies the discipline of the budget process to the hours of reporting time imposed on the public forcing agencies to scrutinize all their forms each year with effective implementation these steps should allow further substantial paperwork cuts in the years ahead  tightening standards for governmental efficiency and integrity  to develop a foundation to carry out energy policy we consolidated scattered energy programs and launched the synthetic fuels corporation to give education the priority it deserves and at the same time reduce hhs to more manageable size i gave education a seat at the cabinet table to create a stronger system for attacking waste and fraud i reorganized audit and investigative functions by putting an inspector general in major agencies since i took office we have submitted 14 reorganization initiatives and had them all approved by congress we have saved hundreds of millions of dollars through the adoption of businesslike cash management principles and set strict standards for personal financial disclosure and conflict of interest avoidance by high federal officials  to streamline the structure of the government we have secured approval of 14 reorganization initiatives improving the efficiency of the most important sectors of the government including energy education and civil rights enforcement we have eliminated more than 300 advisory committees as well as other agencies boards and commissions which were obsolete or ineffective independent inspectors general have been appointed in major agencies to attack fraud and waste more than a billion dollars of questionable transactions have been identified through their audit activities  the adoption of businesslike cash management and debt collection initiatives will save over 1 billion by streamlining the processing of receipts by controlling disbursements more carefully and by reducing idle cash balances finally this administration has set strict standards for personal financial disclosure and conflict of interest avoidance by high federal officials to elevate the level of public trust in the government  v protecting basic rights and liberties  i am extremely proud of the advances we have made in ensuring equality and protecting the basic freedoms of all americans  the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the office of federal contract compliance ofccp have been reorganized and strengthened and a permanent civil rights unit has been established in omb  to avoid fragmented inconsistent and duplicative enforcement of civil rights laws three agencies have been given coordinative and standardsetting responsibilities in discrete areas eeoc for all employmentrelated activities hud for all those relating to housing and the department of justice for all other areas  with the enactment of the right to financial privacy act and a bill limiting police search of newsrooms we have begun to establish a sound comprehensive privacy program  ratification of the equal rights amendment must be aggressively pursued only one year remains in which to obtain ratification by three additional states  the congress must give early attention to a number of important bills which remain these bills would  strengthen the laws against discrimination in housing until it is enacted the 1968 civil rights acts promise of equal access to housing will remain unfulfilled  establish a charter for the fbi and the intelligence agencies the failure to define in law the duties and responsibilities of these agencies has made possible some of the abuses which have occurred in recent years  establish privacy safeguards for medical research bank insurance and credit records and provide special protection for election fund transfer systems  equal rights amendment  i remain committed as strongly as possible to the ratification of the equal rights amendment  as a result of our efforts in 1978 the equal rights amendments deadline for ratification was extended for three years we have now one year and three states left we cannot afford any delay in marshalling our resources and efforts to obtain the ratification of those three additional states  although the congress has no official role in the ratification process at this point you do have the ability to affect public opinion and the support of state legislators for the amendment i urge members from states which have not yet ratified the equal rights amendment to use their influence to secure ratification i will continue my own efforts to help ensure ratification of the equal rights amendment  martin luther king jr  dr martin luther king jr led this nations effort to provide all its citizens with civil rights and equal opportunities his commitment to human rights peace and nonviolence stands as a monument to his humanity and courage as one of our nations most outstanding leaders it is appropriate that his birthday be commemorated as a national holiday i hope the congress will enact legislation this year that will achieve this goal  fair housing  the fair housing act amendments of 1980 passed the house of representatives by an overwhelming bipartisan majority only to die in the senate at the close of the 96th congress the leaders of both parties have pledged to make the enactment of fair housing legislation a top priority of the incoming congress the need is pressing and a strengthened federal enforcement effort must be the primary method of resolution  criminal code  the federal criminal laws are often archaic frequently contradictory and imprecise and clearly in need of revision and codification the new administration should continue the work which has been begun to develop a federal criminal code which simplifies and clarifies our criminal laws while maintaining our basic civil liberties and protections  privacy  as our public and private institutions collect more and more information and as communications and computer technologies advance we must act to protect the personal privacy of our citizens  in the past four years we acted on the report of the privacy commission and established a national privacy policy we worked with congress to pass legislation restricting wiretaps and law enforcement access to bank records and to reporters files we reduced the number of personal files held by the government and restricted the transfer of personal information among federal agencies we also worked with the organization for economic cooperation and development to establish international guidelines to protect the privacy of personal information that is transferred across borders  vi protecting and developing our natural resources  two of our nations most precious natural resources are our environment and our vast agricultural capacity from the beginning of my administration i have worked with the congress to enhance and protect as well as develop our natural resources in the environmental areas i have been especially concerned about the importance of balancing the need for resource development with preserving a clean environment and have taken numerous actions to foster this goal in the agricultural area i have taken the steps needed to improve farm incomes and to increase our agricultural production to record levels that progress must be continued in the 1980s  environment  preserving the quality of our environment has been among the most important objectives of my administration and of the congress as a result of these shared commitments and the dedicated efforts of many members of the congress and my administration we have achieved several historic accomplishments  protection of alaska lands  passage of the alaska national interest lands conservation act was one of the most important conservation actions of this century at stake was the fate of millions of acres of beautiful land outstanding and unique wildlife populations native cultures and the opportunity to ensure that future generations of americans would be able to enjoy the benefits of these nationally significant resources as a result of the leadership commitment and persistence of my administration and the congressional leadership the alaska lands bill was signed into law last december  the act adds 97 million acres of new parks and refuges more than doubling the size of our national park and national wildlife refuge systems the bill triples the size of our national wilderness system increasing its size by 56 million acres and by adding 25 freeflowing river segments to the wild and scenic river system the bill almost doubles the river mileage in that system the alaska lands act reaffirms our commitment to the environment and strikes a balance between protecting areas of great beauty and allowing development of alaskas oil gas mineral and timber resources  protection of natural resources  in addition to the alaska lands act over the past four years we have been able to expand significantly the national wilderness and parks systems in 1978 the congress passed the historical omnibus parks act which made 12 additions to the national park system the act also established the first two national trails since the national trails system act was passed in 1968 then in 1980 as a result of my 1979 environmental message the federal land management agencies have established almost 300 new national recreational trails with the completion of the rare ii process which eliminated the uncertainty surrounding the status of millions of acres of land we called for over 15 million acres of new wilderness in the nations national forest in 1980 the congress established about 45 million acres of wilderness in the lower 48 states in addition the administration recommended legislation to protect lake tahoe and through an executive order has already established a mechanism to help ensure the lakes protection finally in 1980 the administration established the channel islands marine sanctuary  administration actions over the past four years stressed the importance of providing federal support only for water resource projects that are economically and environmentally sound this policy should have a major and lasting influence on the federal governments role in water resource development and management the administrations actions to recommend to the congress only economically and environmentally sound water resource projects for funding resulted not only in our opposing uneconomic projects but also in 1979 in the first administration proposal of new project starts in 4 years  one of the most significant water policy actions of the past four years was the administrations june 6 1978 water policy reform message to the congress this message established a new national water resources policy with the following objectives  to give priority emphasis to water conservation  to consider environmental requirements and values more fully and along with economic factors in the planning and management of water projects and programs  to enhance cooperation between state and federal agencies in water resources planning and management  in addition the executive office of the president established 11 policy decision criteria to evaluate the proposed federal water projects the water resources council developed and adopted a new set of principles and standards for water projects which is binding on all federal construction agencies and improved regulations were developed to implement the national historic preservation act and the fish and wildlife coordination act as a result water resource projects must be determined to be economically sound before the administration will recommend authorization or appropriation over the years ahead this policy will help to reduce wasteful federal spending by targeting federal funds to the highest priority water resource projects  in the pursuit of this policy however we cannot lose projects in the part that sound water resource projects play in providing irrigation power and flood control we must also recognize the special needs of particular regions of the country in evaluating the need for additional projects  addressing global resource and environmental problems  the global 2000 report to the president prepared in response to my 1977 environment message is the first of its kind never before has our government or any government taken such a comprehensive longrange look at the interrelated global issues of resources population and environment  the reports conclusions are important they point to a rapid increase in population and human needs through the year 2000 while at the same time a decline in the earths capacity to meet those needs unless nations of the world act decisively to alter current trends  the united states has contributed actively to a series of un conferences on the environment population and resources and is preparing for the 1981 conference on new and renewable sources of energy following my 1977 environmental message the administration development assistance programs have added emphasis to natural resource management and environmental protection my 1979 environmental message called attention to the alarming loss of world forests particularly in the tropics an interagency task force on tropical forests has developed a us government program to encourage conservation and wise management of tropical forests the administration is encouraging action by other nations and world organizations to the same purpose the united states is a world leader in wildlife conservation and the assessment of environmental effects of government actions the january 5 1979 executive order directing us government agencies to consider the effects of their major actions abroad is another example of this leadership  commitment to control of pollution and hazardous chemicals  over the past four years there has been steady progress towards cleaner air and water sustained by the commitment of congress and the administration to these important national objectives in addition the administration has developed several new pollution compliance approaches such as alternative and innovative waste water treatment projects the bubble concept the offset policy and permit consolidation all of which are designed to reduce regulatory burdens on the private sector  one of the most pressing problems to come to light in the past four years has been improper hazardous waste disposal the administration has moved on three fronts first we proposed the oil hazardous substances and hazardous waste response liability and compensation act the superfund bill to provide comprehensive authority and 16 billion in funds to clean up abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites in november 1980 the congress passed a superfund bill which i signed into law  second the administration established a hazardous waste enforcement strike force to ensure that when available responsible parties are required to clean up sites posing dangers to public health and to the environment to date 50 lawsuits have been brought by the strike force  third regulations implementing subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act were issued the regulations establish comprehensive controls for hazardous waste and together with vigorous enforcement will help to ensure that love canal will not be repeated  the future  for the future we cannot and we must not forget that we are charged with the stewardship of an irreplaceable environment and natural heritage our children and our childrens children are dependent upon our maintaining our commitment to preserving and enhancing the quality of our environment it is my hope that when our descendants look back on the 1980s they will be able to affirm  that we kept our commitment to the restoration of environmental quality  that we protected the public health from the continuing dangers of toxic chemicals from pollution from hazardous and radioactive waste and that we made our communities safer healthier and better places to live  that we preserved americas wilderness areas and particularly its last great frontier alaska for the benefit of all americans in perpetuity  that we put this nation on a path to a sustainable energy future one based increasingly on renewable resources and on energy conservation  that we moved to protect americas countryside and coastland from mismanagement and irresponsibility  that we redirected the management of the nations water resources toward water conservation sound development and environmental protection  that we faced squarely such worldwide problems as the destruction of forests acid rain carbon dioxide buildup and nuclear proliferation and  that we protected the habitat and the existence of our own species on this earth  agriculture the farm economy  the farm economy is sound and its future is bright agriculture remains a major bulwark of the nations economy and an even more important factor in the world food system the demand for americas agricultural abundance here and abroad continues to grow in the nearterm the strength of this demand is expected to press hard against supplies resulting in continued price strength  the health and vitality of currentday agriculture represents a significant departure from the situation that existed when i came to office four years ago in january 1977 the farm economy was in serious trouble farm prices and farm income were falling rapidly grain prices were at their lowest levels in years and steadily falling livestock producers in their fourth straight year of record losses were liquidating breeding herds at an unparalleled rate dairy farmers were losing money on every hundredweight of milk they produced sugar prices were in a nosedive  through a combination of improvements in old established programs and the adoption of new approaches where innovation and change were needed my administration turned this situation around commodity prices have steadily risen farm income turned upward us farm exports set new records each year increasing over 80 percent for the four year period livestock producers began rebuilding their herds dairy farmers began to earn a profit again  recent policy initiatives  several major agricultural policy initiatives have been undertaken over the past year some are the culmination of policy proposals made earlier in this administration others are measures taken to help farmers offset the impact of rapid inflation in production costs in combination they represent a significant strengthening of our nations food and agricultural policy these initiatives include  food security reserve  the congress authorized formation of a 4 million ton food grain reserve for use in international food assistance this reserve makes it possible for the united states to stand behind its food aid commitment to food deficit nations even during periods of short supplies and high prices this corrects a serious fault in our past food assistance policy  comprehensive crop insurance  the congress also authorized a significant new crop insurance program during 1980 this measure provides farmers with an important new program tool for sharing the economic risks that are inherent to agriculture when fully operational it will replace a hodgepodge of disaster programs that suffered from numerous shortcomings  special loan rates  another legislative measure passed late in the 2nd session of the 96th congress authorizes the secretary of agriculture to provide higher loan rates to farmers who enter their grain in the farmerowned grain reserve this additional incentive to participate will further strengthen the reserve  increased loan prices  in july 1980 i administratively raised loan prices for wheat feedgrains and soybeans to help offset the effects of a serious costprice squeeze at the same time the release and call prices for the grain reserve were adjusted upward  higher target prices  the agricultural adjustment act of 1980 raised the target prices for 1980crop wheat and feed grain crops this change corrected for shortcomings in the adjustment formula contained in the food and agriculture act of 1977  future agenda  the food and agricultural policies adopted by this administration over the past four years including those described above will provide a firm foundation for future governmental actions in this field expiration of the food and agriculture act of 1977 later this year will require early attention by the congress with relatively minor changes most of the authorities contained in the 1977 act should be extended in their present form the farmerowned grain reserve has proven to be a particularly effective means of stabilizing grain markets and should be preserved in essentially its present form  beyond this it will be important for the congress to keep a close eye on pricecost developments in the farm sector as noted above some of the actions i took last year were for the purpose of providing relief from the costprice squeeze facing farmers should these pressures continue further actions might be required  my administration has devoted particular attention to the issues of world hunger agricultural land use and the future structure of american agriculture i encourage the congress and the next administration to review the results of these landmark enquiries and where deemed appropriate to act on their recommendations  following a careful review of the situation i recently extended the suspension of grain sales to the soviet union i am satisfied that this action has served its purpose effectively and fairly however as long as this suspension must remain in effect it will be important for the next administration and the congress to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the burden does not fall unfairly on our nations farmers this has been a key feature of my administrations policy and it should be maintained  vii foreign policy  from the time i assumed office four years ago this month i have stressed the need for this country to assert a leading role in a world undergoing the most extensive and intensive change in human history  my policies have been directed in particular at three areas of change  the steady growth and increased projection abroad of soviet military power power that has grown faster than our own over the past two decades  the overwhelming dependence of western nations which now increasingly includes the united states on vital oil supplies from the middle east  the pressures of change in many nations of the developing world in iran and uncertainty about the future stability of many developing countries  as a result of those fundamental facts we face some of the most serious challenges in the history of this nation the soviet invasion of afghanistan is a threat to global peace to eastwest relations and to regional stable flow of oil as the unprecedented relations an and overwhelming vote in the general assembly demonstrated countries across the world and particularly the nonaligned regard the soviet invasion as a threat to their independence and security turmoil within the region adjacent to the persian gulf poses risks for the security and prosperity of every oil importing nation and thus for the entire global economy the continuing holding of american hostages in iran is both an affront to civilized people everywhere and a serious impediment to meeting the selfevident threat to widelyshared common interests including those of iran  but as we focus our most urgent efforts on pressing problems we will continue to pursue the benefits that only change can bring for it always has been the essence of america that we want to move on we understand that prosperity progress and most of all peace cannot be had by standing still a world of nations striving to preserve their independence and of peoples aspiring for economic development and political freedom is not a world hostile to the ideals and interests of the united states we face powerful adversaries but we have strong friends and dependable allies we have common interests with the vast majority of the worlds nations and peoples  there have been encouraging developments in recent years as well as matters requiring continued vigilance and concern  our alliances with the worlds most advanced and democratic states from western europe through japan are stronger than ever  we have helped to bring about a dramatic improvement in relations between egypt and israel and an historic step towards a comprehensive arabisraeli settlement  our relations with china are growing closer providing a major new dimension in our policy in asia and the world  across southern africa from rhodesia to namibia we are helping with the peaceful transition to majority rule in a context of respect for minority as well as majority rights  we have worked domestically and with our allies to respond to an uncertain energy situation by conservation and diversification of energy supplies based on internationally agreed targets  we have unambiguously demonstrated our commitment to defend western interests in southwest asia and we have significantly increased our ability to do so  and over the past four years the us has developed an energy program which is comprehensive and ambitious new institutions have been established such as the synthetic fuels corporation and solar bank price decontrol for oil and gas is proceeding american consumers have risen to the challenge and we have experienced real improvements in consumption patterns  the central challenge for us today is to our steadfastedness of purpose we are no longer tempted by isolationism but we must also learn to deal effectively with the contradictions of the world the need to cooperate with potential adversaries without euphoria without undermining our determination to compete with such adversaries and if necessary confront the threats they may pose to our security  we face a broad range of threats and opportunities we have and should continue to pursue a broad range of defense diplomatic and economic capabilities and objectives  i see six basic goals for america in the world over the 1980s  first we will continue as we have over the past four years to build americas military strength and that of our allies and friends neither the soviet union nor any other nation will have reason to question our will to sustain the strongest and most flexible defense forces  second we will pursue an active diplomacy in the world working together with our friends and allies to resolve disputes through peaceful means and to make any aggressor pay a heavy price  third we will strive to resolve pressing international economic problems particularly energy and inflation and continue to pursue our still larger objective of global economic growth through expanded trade and development assistance and through the preservation of an open multilateral trading system  fourth we will continue vigorously to support the process of building democratic institutions and improving human rights protection around the world we are deeply convinced that the future lies not with dictatorship but democracy  fifth we remain deeply committed to the process of mutual and verifiable arms control particularly to the effort to prevent the spread and further development of nuclear weapons our decision to defer but not abandon our efforts to secure ratification of the salt ii treaty reflects our firm conviction that the united states has a profound national security interest in the constraints on soviet nuclear forces which only that treaty can provide  sixth we must continue to look ahead in order to evaluate and respond to resource environment and population challenges through the end of this century  one very immediate and pressing objective that is uppermost on our minds and those of the american people is the release of our hostages in iran  we have no basic quarrel with the nation the revolution or the people of iran the threat to them comes not from american policy but from soviet actions in the region we are prepared to work with the government of iran to develop a new and mutually beneficial relationship  but that will not be possible so long as iran continues to hold americans hostages in defiance of the world community and civilized behavior they must be released unharmed we have thus far pursued a measured program of peaceful diplomatic and economic steps in an attempt to resolve this issue without resorting to other remedies available to us under international law this reflects the deep respect of our nation for the rule of law and for the safety of our people being held and our belief that a great power bears a responsibility to use its strength in a measured and judicious manner but our patience is not unlimited and our concern for the wellbeing of our fellow citizens grows each day  enhancing national security american military strength  the maintenance of national security is my first concern as it has been for every president before me  we must have both the military power and the political will to deter our adversaries and to support our friends and allies  we must pay whatever price is required to remain the strongest nation in the world that price has increased as the military power of our major adversary has grown and its readiness to use that power been made all too evident in afghanistan the real increases in defense spending therefore probably will be higher than previously projected protecting our security may require a larger share of our national wealth in the future  the ussoviet relationship  we are demonstrating to the soviet union across a broad front that it will pay a heavy price for its aggression in terms of our relationship throughout the last decades ussoviet relations have been a mixture of cooperation and competition the soviet invasion of afghanistan and the imposition of a puppet government have highlighted in the starkest terms the darker side of their policies going well beyond competition and the legitimate pursuit of national interest and violating all norms of international law and practice  this attempt to subjugate an independent nonaligned islamic people is a callous violation of international law and the united nations charter two fundamentals of international order hence it is also a dangerous threat to world peace for the first time since the communization of eastern europe after world war ii the soviets have sent combat forces into an area that was not previously under their control into a nonaligned and sovereign state  the destruction of the independence of the afghanistan government and the occupation by the soviet union have altered the strategic situation in that part of the world in a very ominous fashion it has significantly shortened the striking distance to the indian ocean and the persian gulf for the soviet union  it has also eliminated a buffer between the soviet union and pakistan and presented a new threat to iran these two countries are now far more vulnerable to soviet political intimidation if that intimidation were to prove effective the soviet union could control an area of vital strategic and economic significance to the survival of western europe the far east and ultimately the united states  it has now been over a year since the soviet invasion of afghanistan dealt a major blow to ussoviet relations and the entire international system the us response has proven to be serious and farreaching it has been increasingly effective imposing real and sustained costs on the ussrs economy and international image  meanwhile we have encouraged and supported efforts to reach a political settlement in afghanistan which would lead to a withdrawal of soviet forces from that country and meet the interests of all concerned it is soviet intransigence that has kept those efforts from bearing fruit  meanwhile an overwhelming november resolution of the united nations general assembly on afghanistan has again made clear that the world has not and will not forget afghanistan and our response continues to make it clear that soviet use of force in pursuit of its international objectives is incompatible with the notion of businessasusual  bilateral communication  ussoviet relations remain strained by the continued soviet presence in afghanistan by growing soviet military capabilities and by the soviets apparent willingness to use those capabilities without respect for the most basic norms of international behavior  but the ussoviet relationship remains the single most important element in determining whether there will be war or peace and so despite serious strains in our relations we have maintained a dialogue with the soviet union over the past year through this dialogue we have ensured against bilateral misunderstandings and miscalculations which might escalate out of control and have managed to avoid the injection of superpower rivalries into areas of tension like the iraniraq conflict  poland  now as was the case a year ago the prospect of soviet use of force threatens the international order the soviet union has completed preparations for a possible military intervention against poland although the situation in poland has shown signs of stabilizing recently soviet forces remain in a high state of readiness and they could move into poland on short notice we continue to believe that the polish people should be allowed to work out their internal problems themselves without outside interference and we have made clear to the soviet leadership that any intervention in poland would have severe and prolonged consequences for eastwest detente and ussoviet relations in particular  defense budget  for many years the soviets have steadily increased their real defense spending expanded their strategic forces strengthened their forces in europe and asia and enhanced their capability for projecting military force around the world directly or through the use of proxies afghanistan dramatizes the vastly increased military power of the soviet union  the soviet union has built a war machine far beyond any reasonable requirements for their own defense and security in contrast our own defense spending declined in real terms every year from 1968 through 1976  we have reversed this decline in our own effort every year since 1976 there has been a real increase in our defense spending and our lead has encouraged increases by our allies with the support of the congress we must and will make an even greater effort in the years ahead  the fiscal year 1982 budget would increase funding authority for defense to more than 196 billion this amount together with a supplemental request for fy 1981 of about 6 billion will more than meet my administrations pledge for a sustained growth of 3 percent in real expenditures and provides for 5 percent in program growth in fy 1982 and beyond  the trends we mean to correct cannot be remedied overnight we must be willing to see this program through to ensure that we do so i am setting a growth rate for defense that we can sustain over the long haul  the defense program i have proposed for the next five years will require some sacrifice but sacrifice we can well afford  the defense program emphasizes four areas  1 it ensures that our strategic nuclear forces will be equivalent to those of the soviet union and that deterrence against nuclear war will be maintained 2 it upgrades our forces so that the military balance between nato and the warsaw pact will continue to deter the outbreak of war conventional or nuclear in europe 3 it provides us the ability to come quickly to the aid of friends and allies around the globe 4 and it ensures that our navy will continue to be the most powerful on the seas  strategic forces  we are strengthening each of the three legs of our strategic forces the cruise missile production which will begin next year will modernize our strategic air deterrent b52 capabilities will also be improved these steps will maintain and enhance the b52 fleet by improving its ability to deliver weapons against increasingly heavily defended targets  we are also modernizing our strategic submarine force four more poseidon submarines backfitted with new 4000 mile trident i missiles began deployments in 1980 nine trident submarines have been authorized through 1981 and we propose one more each year  the new mx missile program to enhance our landbased intercontinental ballistic missile force continues to make progress technical refinements in the basing design over the last year will result in operational benefits lower costs and reduced environmental impact the mx program continues to be an essential ingredient in our strategic posture providing survivability endurance secure command and control and the capability to threaten targets the soviets hold dear  our new systems will enable us strategic forces to maintain equivalence in the face of the mounting soviet challenge we would however need an even greater investment in strategic systems to meet the likely soviet buildup without salt  strategic doctrine  this administrations systematic contributions to the necessary evolution of strategic doctrine began in 1977 when i commissioned a comprehensive net assessment from that base a number of thorough investigations of specific topics continued i should emphasize that the need for an evolutionary doctrine is driven not by any change in our basic objective which remains peace and freedom for all mankind rather the need for change is driven by the inexorable buildup of soviet military power and the increasing propensity of soviet leaders to use this power in coercion and outright aggression to impose their will on others  i have codified our evolving strategic doctrine in a number of interrelated and mutually supporting presidential directives their overarching theme is to provide a doctrinal basis and the specific program to implement it that tells the world that no potential adversary of the united states could ever conclude that the fruits of his aggression would be significant or worth the enormous costs of our retaliation  the presidential directives include  pd18 an overview of our strategic objectives pd37 basic space policy pd41 civil defense pd53 survivability and endurance for telecommunications pd57 mobilization planning pd58 continuity of government pd59 countervailing strategy for general war  these policies have been devised to deter first and foremost soviet aggression as such they confront not only soviet military forces but also soviet military doctrine by definition deterrence requires that we shape soviet assessments about the risks of war assessments they will make using their doctrine not ours  but at the same time we in no way seek to emulate their doctrine in particular nothing in our policy contemplates that nuclear warfare could ever be a deliberate instrument for achieving our own goals of peace and freedom moreover our policies are carefully devised to provide the greatest possible incentives and opportunities for future progress in arms control  finally our doctrinal evolution has been undertaken with appropriate consultation with our nato allies and others we are fully consistent with natos strategy of flexible response  forces for nato  we are greatly accelerating our ability to reinforce western europe with massive ground and air forces in a crisis we are undertaking a major modernization program for the armys weapons and equipment adding armor firepower and tactical mobility  we are prepositioning more heavy equipment in europe to help us cope with attacks with little warning and greatly strengthening our airlift and sealift capabilities  we are also improving our tactical air forces buying about 1700 new fighter and attack aircraft over the next five years and increasing the number of air force fighter wings by over 10 percent  we are working closely with our european allies to secure the host nation support necessary to enable us to deploy more quickly a greater ratio of combat forces to the european theater at a lower cost to the united states  security assistance  as we move to enhance us defense capabilities we must not lose sight of the need to assist others in maintaining their own security and independence events since world war ii most recently in southwest asia have amply demonstrated that us security cannot exist in a vacuum and that our own prospects for peace are closely tied to those of our friends the security assistance programs which i am proposing for the coming fiscal year thus directly promote vital us foreign policy and national security aims and are integral parts of our efforts to improve and upgrade our own military forces  more specifically these programs which are part of our overall foreign aid request promote us security in two principal ways first they assist friendly and allied nations to develop the capability to defend themselves and maintain their own independence an example during this past year was the timely support provided thailand to help bolster that countrys defenses against the large numbers of sovietbacked vietnamese troops ranged along its eastern frontier in addition over the years these programs have been important to the continued independence of other friends and allies such as israel greece turkey and korea second security assistance constitutes an essential element in the broad cooperative relationships we have established with many nations which permit either us bases on their territory or access by us forces to their facilities these programs have been particularly important with regard to the recentlyconcluded access agreements with various countries in the persian gulf and indian ocean regions and have been crucial to the protection of our interests throughout southwest asia  rapid deployment forces  we are systematically enhancing our ability to respond rapidly to nonnato contingencies wherever required by our commitments or when our vital interests are threatened  the rapid deployment forces we are assembling will be extraordinarily flexible they could range in size from a few ships or air squadrons to formations as large as 100000 men together with their support our forces will be prepared for rapid deployment to any region of strategic significance  among the specific initiatives we are taking to help us respond to crises outside of europe are  the development of a new fleet of large cargo aircraft with intercontinental range the design and procurement of a force of maritime prepositioning ships that will carry heavy equipment and supplies for three marine corps brigades the procurement of fast sealift ships to move large quantities of men and material quickly from the us to overseas areas of deployment increasing training and exercise activities to ensure that our forces will be well prepared to deploy and operate in distant areas  in addition our european allies have agreed on the importance of providing support to us deployments to southwest asia  naval forces  seapower is indispensable to our global position in peace and also in war our shipbuilding program will sustain a 550ship navy in the 1990s and we will continue to build the most capable ships afloat  the program i have proposed will assure the ability of our navy to operate in high threat areas to maintain control of the seas and protect vital lines of communication both military and economic and to provide the strong maritime component of our rapid deployment forces this is essential for operations in remote areas of the world where we cannot predict far in advance the precise location of trouble or preposition equipment on land  military personnel  no matter how capable or advanced our weapons systems our military security depends on the abilities the training and the dedication of the people who serve in our armed forces i am determined to recruit and to retain under any foreseeable circumstances an ample level of such skilled and experienced military personnel this administration has supported for fy 1981 the largest peacetime increase ever in military pay and allowances  we have enhanced our readiness and combat endurance by improving the reserve components all reservists are assigned to units structured to complement and provide needed depth to our active forces some reserve personnel have also now been equipped with new equipment  mobilization planning  we have completed our first phase of mobilization planning the first such presidentiallydirected effort since world war ii the governmentwide exercise of our mobilization plans at the end of 1980 showed first that planning pays off and second that much more needs to be done  our intelligence posture  our national interests are critically dependent on a strong and effective intelligence capability we will maintain and strengthen the intelligence capabilities needed to assure our national security maintenance of and continued improvements in our multifaceted intelligence effort are essential if we are to cope successfully with the turbulence and uncertainties of todays world  the intelligence budget i have submitted to the congress responds to our needs in a responsible way providing for significant growth over the fiscal year 1981 budget this growth will enable us to develop new technical means of intelligence collection while also assuring that the more traditional methods of intelligence work are also given proper stress we must continue to integrate both modes of collection in our analyses  regional policies  every president for over three decades has recognized that americas interests are global and that we must pursue a global foreign policy  two world wars have made clear our stake in western europe and the north atlantic area we are also inextricably linked with the far east politically economically and militarily in both of these the united states has a permanent presence and security commitments which would be automatically triggered we have become increasingly conscious of our growing interests in a third area the middle east and the persian gulf area  we have vital stakes in other major regions of the world as well we have long recognized that in an era of interdependence our own security and prosperity depend upon a larger common effort with friends and allies throughout the world  the atlantic alliance  in recognition of the threat which the soviet invasion of afghanistan posed to western interests in both europe and southwest asia nato foreign and defense ministers have expressed full support for us efforts to develop a capability to respond to a contingency in southwest asia and have approved an extensive program to help fill the gap which could be created by the diversion of us forces to that region  the us has not been alone in seeking to maintain stability in the southwest asia area and insure access to the needed resources there the european nations with the capability to do so are improving their own forces in the region and providing greater economic and political support to the residents of the area in the face of the potential danger posed by the iraniraq conflict we have developed coordination among the western forces in the area of the persian gulf in order to be able to safeguard passage in that essential waterway  concerning developments in and around poland the allies have achieved the highest level of cohesion and unity of purpose in making clear the effects on future eastwest relations of a precipitous soviet act there  the alliance has continued to build on the progress of the past three years in improving its conventional forces through the longterm defense program though economic conditions throughout europe today are making its achievement difficult the yearly real increase of 3 percent in defense spending remains a goal actively sought by the alliance  the nato alliance also has moved forward during the past year with the implementation of its historic december 1979 decision to modernize its theater nuclear force capabilities through deployment of improved pershing ballistic missiles and groundlaunched cruise missiles in europe our allies continue to cooperate actively with us in this important joint endeavor whose purpose is to demonstrate convincingly to the soviet union the potential costs of a nuclear conflict in europe at the same time we offered convincing evidence of our commitment to arms control in europe by initiating preliminary consultations with the soviet union in geneva on the subject of negotiated limits on longrange theater nuclear forces also during 1980 we initiated and carried out a withdrawal from our nuclear weapons stockpile in europe of 1000 nuclear warheads this successful drawdown in our nuclear stockpile was a further tangible demonstration of our commitment to the updating of our existing theater nuclear forces in europe  in the nato area we continued to work closely with other countries in providing resources to help turkey regain economic health we regretted that massive political and internal security problems led the turkish military to take over the government on september 12 the new turkish authorities are making some progress in resolving those problems and they have pledged an early return to civilian government the tradition of the turkish military gives us cause to take that pledge seriously we welcomed the reestablishment of greeces links to the integrated military command structure of the atlantic alliancea move which we had strongly encouragedas a major step toward strengthening natos vital southern flank at a time of international crisis and tension in adjacent areas greek reintegration exemplifies the importance which the allies place on cooperating in the common defense and shows that the allies can make the difficult decisions necessary to insure their continued security we also welcomed the resumption of the intercommunal talks on cyprus  the us and the pacific nations  the united states is a pacific nation as much as it is an atlantic nation our interests in asia are as important to us as our interests in europe our trade with asia is as great as our trade with europe during the past four years we have regained a strong dynamic and flexible posture for the united states in this vital region  our major alliances with japan australia and new zealand are now stronger than they ever have been and together with the nations of western europe we have begun to form the basic political structure for dealing with international crises that affect us all japan australia and new zealand have given us strong support in developing a strategy for responding to instability in the persian gulf  normalization of us relations with china has facilitated chinas full entry into the international community and encouraged a constructive chinese role in the asiapacific region our relations with china have been rapidly consolidated over the past year through the conclusion of a series of bilateral agreements we have established a pattern of frequent and frank consultations between our two governments exemplified by a series of highlevel visits and by regular exchanges at the working level through which we have been able to identify increasingly broad areas of common interest on which we can cooperate  united states relations with the association of southeast asian nations asean have also expanded dramatically in the past four years asean is now the focus for us policy in southeast asia and its cohesion and strength are essential to stability in this critical area and beyond  sovietsupported vietnamese aggression in indochina has posed a major challenge to regional stability in response we have reiterated our security commitment to thailand and have provided emergency security assistance for thai forces facing a vietnamese military threat along the thaicambodian border we have worked closely with asean and the un to press for withdrawal of vietnamese forces from cambodia and to encourage a political settlement in cambodia which permits that nation to be governed by leaders of its own choice we still look forward to the day when cambodia peacefully can begin the process of rebuilding its social economic and political institutions after years of devastation and occupation and on humanitarian grounds and in support of our friends in the region we have worked vigorously with international organizations to arrange relief and resettlement for the exodus of indochinese refugees which threatened to overwhelm these nations  we have maintained our alliance with korea and helped assure koreas security during a difficult period of political transition  we have amended our military base agreement with the philippines ensuring stable access to these bases through 1991 the importance of our philippine bases to the strategic flexibility of us forces and our access to the indian ocean is selfevident  finally we are in the process of concluding a long negotiation establishing micronesias status as a freely associated state  we enter the 1980s with a firm strategic footing in east asia and the pacific based on stable and productive us relations with the majority of countries of the region we have established a stable level of us involvement in the region appropriate to our own interests and to the interests of our friends and allies there  the middle east and southwest asia  the continuing soviet occupation of afghanistan and the dislocations caused by the iraqiran war serve as constant reminders of the critical importance for us and our allies of a third strategic zone stretching across the middle east the persian gulf and much of the indian subcontinent this southwest asian region has served as a key strategic and commercial link between east and west over the centuries today it produces twothirds of the worlds oil exports providing most of the energy needs of our european allies and japan it has experienced almost continuous conflict between nations internal instabilities in many countries and regional rivalries combined with very rapid economic and social change and now the soviet union remains in occupation of one of these nations ignoring world opinion which has called on it to get out  we have taken several measures to meet these challenges  middle east  in the middle east our determination to consolidate what has already been achieved in the peace processand to buttress that accomplishment with further progress toward a comprehensive peace settlementmust remain a central goal of our foreign policy pursuant to their peace treaty egypt and israel have made steady progress in the normalization of their relations in a variety of fields bringing the benefits of peace directly to their people the new relationship between egypt and israel stands as an example of peaceful cooperation in an increasingly fragmented and turbulent region  both president sadat and prime minister begin remain committed to the current negotiations to provide full autonomy to the inhabitants of the west bank and gaza these negotiations have been complex and difficult but they have already made significant progress and it is vital that the two sides with our assistance see the process through to a successful conclusion we also recognize the need to broaden the peace process to include other parties to the conflict and believe that a successful autonomy agreement is an essential first step toward this objective  we have also taken a number of steps to strengthen our bilateral relations with both israel and egypt we share important strategic interests with both of these countries  we remain committed to israels security and are prepared to take concrete steps to support israel whenever that security is threatened  persian gulf  the persian gulf has been a vital crossroads for trade between europe and asia at many key moments in history it has become essential in recent years for its supply of oil to the united states our allies and our friends we have taken effective measures to control our own consumption of imported fuel working in cooperation with the other key industrial  nations of the world however there is little doubt that the healthy growth of our american and world economies will depend for many years on continued safe access to the persian gulfs oil production the denial of these oil supplies would threaten not only our own but world security  the potent new threat from an advancing soviet union against the background of regional instability of which it can take advantage requires that we reinforce our ability to defend our regional friends and to protect the flow of oil we are continuing to build on the strong political economic social and humanitarian ties which bind this government and the american people to friendly governments and peoples of the persian gulf  we have also embarked on a course to reinforce the trust and confidence our regional friends have in our ability to come to their assistance rapidly with american military force if needed we have increased our naval presence in the indian ocean we have created a rapid deployment force which can move quickly to the gulfor indeed any other area of the world where outside aggression threatens we have concluded several agreements with countries which are prepared to let us use their airports and naval facilities in an emergency we have met requests for reasonable amounts of american weaponry from regional countries which are anxious to defend themselves and we are discussing with a number of our area friends further ways we can help to improve their security and ours both for the short and the longer term  south asia  we seek a south asia comprising sovereign and stable states free of outside interference which can strengthen their political institutions according to their own national genius and can develop their economies for the betterment of their people  the soviet invasion of afghanistan has posed a new challenge to this region and particularly to neighboring pakistan we are engaged in a continuing dialogue with the pakistan government concerning its development and security requirements and the economic burden imposed by afghan refugees who have fled to pakistan we are participating with other aid consortium members in debt rescheduling and will continue to cooperate through the unhcr in providing refugee assistance we remain committed to pakistans territorial integrity and independence  developments in the broad southsouthwest asian region have also lent a new importance to our relations with india the largest and strongest power in the area we share indias interest in a more constructive relationship indian policies and perceptions at times differ from our own and we have established a candid dialogue with this sister democracy which seeks to avoid the misunderstandings which have sometimes complicated our ties  we attach major importance to strong economic assistance programs to the countries in the area which include a majority of the poor of the noncommunist world we believe that these programs will help achieve stability in the area an objective we share with the countries in the region great progress has been achieved by these countries in increasing food production international cooperation in harnessing the great river resources of south asia would contribute further to this goal and help to increase energy production  we continue to give high priority to our nonproliferation goals in the area in the context of our broad global and regional priorities the decision to continue supply of nuclear fuel to the indian tarapur reactors was sensitive to this effort  africa  the united states has achieved a new level of trust and cooperation with africa our efforts together with our allies to achieve peace in southern africa our increased efforts to help the poorest countries in africa to combat poverty and our expanded efforts to promote trade and investment have led to growing respect for the us and to cooperation in areas of vital interest to the united states  africa is a continent of poor nations for the most part it also contains many of the mineral resources vital for our economy we have worked with africa in a spirit of mutual cooperation to help the african nations solve their problems of poverty and to develop stronger ties between our private sector and african economies our assistance to africa has more than doubled in the last four years equally important we set in motion new mechanisms for private investment and trade  nigeria is the largest country in black africa and the second largest oil supplier to the united states during this administration we have greatly expanded and improved our relationship with nigeria and other west african states whose aspirations for a constitutional democratic order we share and support this interest was manifested both symbolically and practically by the visit of vice president mondale to west africa in july 1980 and the successful visit to washington of the president of nigeria in october  during vice president mondales visit a joint agricultural consultative committee was established with the us represented entirely by the private sector this could herald a new role for the american private sector in helping solve the worlds serious food shortages i am pleased to say that our relations with nigeria are at an alltime high providing the foundation for an even stronger relationship in the years ahead  another tenet of this administrations approach to african problems has been encouragement and support for regional solutions to africas problems we have supported initiatives by the organization of african unity to solve the protracted conflict in the western sahara chad and the horn in chad the world is watching with dismay as a country torn by a devastating civil war has become a fertile field for libyas exploitation thus demonstrating that threats to peace can come from forces within as well as without africa  in southern africa the united states continues to pursue a policy of encouraging peaceful development toward majority rule in 1980 southern rhodesia became independent as zimbabwe a multiracial nation under a system of majority rule zimbabwean independence last april was the culmination of a long struggle within the country and diplomatic efforts involving great britain african states neighboring zimbabwe and the united states  the focus of our efforts in pursuit of majority rule in southern africa has now turned to namibia negotiations are proceeding among concerned parties under the leadership of un secretary general waldheim this should lead to implementation of the un plan for selfdetermination and independence for namibia during 1981 if these negotiations are successfully concluded sixtyfive years of uncertainty over the status of the territory including a sevenyearlong war will be ended  in response to our active concern with issues of importance to africans african states have cooperated with us on issues of importance to our national interests african states voted overwhelmingly in favor of the un resolution calling for release of the hostages and for the un resolution condemning the soviet invasion of afghanistan two countries of africa have signed access agreements with the us allowing us use of naval and air facilities in the indian ocean  africans have become increasingly vocal on human rights african leaders have spoken out on the issue of political prisoners and the oau is drafting its own charter on human rights three countries in africa nigeria ghana and ugandahave returned to civilian rule during the past year  us cooperation with africa on all these matters represents a strong base on which we can build in future years  liberia is a country of longstanding ties with the us and the site of considerable us investment and facilities this past april a coup replaced the government and a period of political and economic uncertainty ensued the us acted swiftly to meet this situation we together with african leaders urged the release of political prisoners and many have been released we provided emergency economic assistance to help avoid economic collapse and helped to involve the imf and the banking community to bring about economic stability and we have worked closely with the new leaders to maintain liberias strong ties with the west and to protect americas vital interests  north africa  in early 1979 following a libyaninspired commando attack on a tunisian provincial city the us responded promptly to tunisias urgent request for assistance both by airlifting needed military equipment and by making clear our longstanding interest in the security and integrity of this friendly country the us remains determined to oppose other irresponsible libyan aspirations despairing of a productive dialogue with the libyan authorities the us closed down its embassy in libya and later expelled six libyan diplomats in washington in order to deter an intimidation campaign against libyan citizens in the us  us relations with algeria have improved and algeria has played an indispensable and effective role as intermediary between iran and the us over the hostage issue  the strengthening of our arms supply relationship with morocco has helped to deal with attacks inside its internationally recognized frontiers and to strengthen its confidence in seeking a political settlement of the western sahara conflict while not assuming a mediatory role the us encouraged all interested parties to turn their energies to a peaceful and sensible compromise resolution of the war in the sahara and supported efforts by the organization of african unity toward that end as the year drew to a close the us was encouraged by evolution in the attitudes of all sides and is hopeful that their differences will be peacefully resolved in the year ahead so that the vast economic potential of north africa can be developed for the wellbeing of the people living there  latin america and the caribbean  the principles of our policies in this hemisphere have been clear and constant over the last four years we support democracy and respect for human rights we have struggled with many to help free the region of both repression and terrorism we have respected ideological diversity and opposed outside intervention in purely internal affairs we will act though in response to a request for assistance by a country threatened by external aggression we support social and economic development within a democratic framework we support the peaceful settlement of disputes we strongly encourage regional cooperation and shared responsibilities within the hemisphere to all these ends and we have eagerly and regularly sought the advice of the leaders of the region on a wide range of issues  last november i spoke to the general assembly of the organization of american states of a cause that has been closest to my hearthuman rights it is an issue that has found its time in the hemisphere the cause is not mine alone but an historic movement that will endure  at riobamba ecuador last september four andean pact countries costa rica and panama broke new ground by adopting a code of conduct that joint action in defense of human rights does not violate the principles of nonintervention in the internal affairs of states in this hemisphere the organization of american states has twice condemned the coup that overturned the democratic process in bolivia and the widespread abuse of human rights by the regime which seized power the interamerican commission on human rights has gained world acclaim for its dispassionate reports it completed two major country studies this year in addition to its annual report in a resolution adopted without opposition the oas general assembly in november strongly supported the work of the commission the american convention on human rights is in force and an interamerican court has been created to judge human rights violations this convention has been pending before the senate for two years i hope the united states this year will join the other nations of the hemisphere in ratifying a convention which embodies principles that are our tradition  the trend in favor of democracy has continued during this past year peru inaugurated a democratically elected government brazil continues its process of liberalization in central america hondurans voted in record numbers in their first national elections in over eight years in the caribbean seven elections have returned governments firmly committed to the democratic traditions of the commonwealth  another major contribution to peace in the hemisphere is latin americas own treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons on behalf of the united states i signed protocol i of this treaty in may of 1977 and sent it to the senate for ratification i urge that it be acted upon promptly by the senate in order that it be brought into the widest possible effect in the latin american region  regional cooperation for development is gaining from central america to the andes and throughout the caribbean the caribbean group for cooperation in economic development which we established with 29 other nations in 1977 has helped channel 750 million in external support for growth in the caribbean the recent meeting of the chiefs of state of the eastern caribbean set a new precedent for cooperation in that region mexico and venezuela jointly and trinidad and tobago separately have established oil facilities that will provide substantial assistance to their oil importing neighbors the peace treaty between el salvador and honduras will hopefully stimulate central america to move forward again toward economic integration formation of caribbean central american action a private sector organization has given a major impetus to improving peopletopeople bonds and strengthening the role of private enterprise in the development of democratic societies  the panama treaties have been in force for over a year a new partnership has been created with panama it is a model for large and small nations a longstanding issue that divided us from our neighbors has been resolved the security of the canal has been enhanced the canal is operating as well as ever with traffic through it reaching record levels this year canal employees american and panamanian alike have remained on the job and have found their living and working conditions virtually unchanged  in 1980 relations with mexico continued to improve due in large measure to the effectiveness of the coordinator for mexican affairs and the expanded use of the usmexico consultative mechanism by holding periodic meetings of its various working groups we have been able to prevent mutual concerns from becoming political issues the secretary of state visited mexico city in november and along with the mexican secretary of foreign relations reviewed the performance of the consultative mechanism the office of the coordinator has ensured the implementation of my directive to all agencies to accord high priority to mexican concerns trade with mexico rose by almost 60 percent to nearly 30 billion making that country our third largest trading partner  these are all encouraging developments other problems remain however  the impact of largescale migration is affecting many countries in the hemisphere the most serious manifestation was the massive illegal exodus from cuba last summer the cuban government unilaterally encouraged the disorderly and even deadly migration of 125000 of its citizens in complete disregard for international law or the immigration laws of its neighbors migrations of this nature clearly require concerted action and we have asked the oas to explore means of dealing with similar situations which may occur in the future  we have a longstanding treaty with colombia on quita sueno roncador and serrano which remains to be ratified by the senate  in central america the future of nicaragua is unclear recent tensions the restrictions on the press and political activity an inordinate cuban presence in the country and the tragic killing by the security forces of a businessman well known for his democratic orientation cause us considerable concern these are not encouraging developments but those who seek a free society remain in the contest for their nations destiny they have asked us to help rebuild their country and by our assistance to demonstrate that the democratic nations do not intend to abandon nicaragua to the cubans as long as those who intend to pursue their pluralistic goals play important roles in nicaragua it deserves our continuing support  in el salvador we have supported the efforts of the junta to change the fundamental basis of an inequitable system and to give a stake in a new nation to those millions of people who for so long lived without hope or dignity as the government struggles against those who would restore an old tyranny or impose a new one the united states will continue to stand behind them  we have increased our aid to the caribbean an area vital to our national security and we should continue to build close relations based on mutual respect and understanding and common interests  as the nations of this hemisphere prepare to move further into the 1980s i am struck by the depth of underlying commitment that there is to our common principles nonintervention peaceful settlement of disputes cooperation for development democracy and defense of basic human rights i leave office satisfied that the political economic social and organizational basis for further progress with respect to all these principles have been substantially strengthened in the past four years i am particularly reassured by the leadership by other nations of the hemisphere in advancing these principles the success of our common task of improving the circumstances of all peoples and nations in the hemisphere can only be assured by the sharing of responsibility i look forward to a hemisphere that at the end of this decade has proven itself anew as a leader in the promotion of both national and human dignity  the international economy  a growing defense effort and a vigorous foreign policy rest upon a strong economy here in the united states and the strength of our own economy depends upon our ability to lead and compete in the international marketplace  energy  last year the war between iraq and iran led to the loss of nearly 4 million barrels of oil to world markets the third major oil market disruption in the past seven years this crisis has vividly demonstrated once again both the value of lessened dependence on oil imports and the continuing instability of the persian gulf area  under the leadership of the united states the 21 members of the international energy agency took collective action to ensure that the oil shortfall stemming from the iraniraq war would not be aggravated by competition for scarce spot market supplies we are also working together to see that those nations most seriously affected by the oil disruption including our key nato allies turkey and portugalcan get the oil they need at the most recent iea ministerial meeting we joined the other members in pledging to take those policy measures necessary to slice our joint oil imports in the first quarter of 1981 by 22 million barrels  our international cooperation efforts in the energy field are not limited to crisis management at the economic summit meetings in tokyo and venice the heads of government of the seven major industrial democracies agreed to a series of tough energy conservation and production goals we are working together with all our allies and friends in this effort  construction has begun on a commercial scale coal liquefaction plant in west virginia cofinanced by the united states japan and west germany an interagency task force has just reported to me on a series of measures we need to take to increase coal production and exports this report builds on the work of the international energy agencys coal industry advisory board with the assurances of a reliable united states steam coal supply at reasonable prices many of the electric power plants to be built in the 1980s and 1990s can be coalfired rather than oilburning  we are working cooperatively with other nations to increase energy security in other areas as well joint research and development with our allies is underway in solar energy nuclear power industrial conservation and other areas in addition we are assisting rapidly industrializing nations to carefully assess their basic energy policy choices and our development assistance program helps the developing countries to increase indigenous energy production to meet the energy needs of their poorest citizens we support the proposal for a new world bank energy affiliate to these same ends whose fulfillment will contribute to a better global balance between energy supply and demand  international monetary policy  despite the rapid increase in oil costs the policy measures we have taken to improve domestic economic performance have had a continued powerful effect on our external accounts and on the strength of the dollar a strong dollar helps in the fight against inflation  there has also been considerable forward movement in efforts to improve the functioning of the international monetary system the stability of the international system of payments and trade is important to the stability and good health of our own economy we have given strong support to the innovative steps being taken by the international monetary fund and world bank to help promote early adjustment to the difficult international economic problems recent agreement to increase quotas by fifty percent will ensure the imf has sufficient resources to perform its central role in promoting adjustment and financing payments imbalances the world banks new structural adjustment lending program will also make an important contribution to international efforts to help countries achieve a sustainable level of growth and development  sugar  in 1980 congress passed us implementing legislation for the international sugar agreement thus fulfilling a major commitment of this administration the agreement is an important element in our international commodity policy with farreaching implications for our relations with developing countries particularly sugar producers in latin america producers and consumers alike will benefit from a more stable market for this essential commodity  coffee  at years end congress approved implementing legislation permitting the us to carry out fully its commitments under international coffee agreement specifically the legislation enables us to meet our part of an understanding negotiated last fall among members of the agreement which defends by use of export quotas a price range well below coffee prices of previous years and which commits major coffee producers to eliminate cartel arrangements that manipulated future markets to raise prices the way is now open to a fullyfunctioning international coffee agreement which can help to stabilize this major world commodity market the results will be positive for both consumerswho will be less likely to suffer from sharp increases in coffee pricesand producerswho can undertake future investment with assurance of greater protection against disruptive price fluctuations in their exports  natural rubber  in 1980 the international natural rubber agreement entered into force provisionally us membership in this new body was approved overwhelmingly by the senate last year the natural rubber agreement is a model of its kind and should make a substantial contribution to a stable world market in this key industrial commodity it is thus an excellent example of constructive steps to improve the operation of the world economy in ways which can benefit the developing and industrialized countries alike in particular the agreement has improved important us relationships with the major natural rubberproducing countries of southeast asia  common fund  the united states joined members of the united nations conference on trade and development both developed and developing nations in concluding articles of agreement in 1980 for a common fund to help international commodity agreements stabilize the prices of raw materials  economic cooperation with developing nations  our relations with the developing nations are of major importance to the united states the fabric of our relations with these countries has strong economic and political dimensions they constitute the most rapidly growing markets for our exports and are important sources of fuel and raw materials their political views are increasingly important as demonstrated in their overwhelming condemnation of the soviet invasion of afghanistan our ability to work together with developing nations toward goals we have in common their political independence the resolution of regional tensions and our growing ties of trade for example require us to maintain the policy of active involvement with the developing world that we have pursued over the past four years  the actions we have taken in such areas as energy trade commodities and international financial institutions are all important to the welfare of the developing countries another important way the united states can directly assist these countries and demonstrate our concern for their future is through our multilateral and bilateral foreign assistance program the legislation which i will be submitting to you for fy 82 provides the authority and the funds to carry on this activity prompt congressional action on this legislation is essential in order to attack such high priority global problems as food and energy meet our treaty and base rights agreements continue our peace efforts in the middle east provide economic and development support to countries in need promote progress on northsouth issues protect western interests and counter soviet influence  our proposed fy 1982 bilateral development aid program is directly responsive to the agreement reached at the 1980 venice economic summit that the major industrial nations should increase their aid for food and energy production and for family planning we understand that other summit countries plan similar responses it is also important to honor our international agreements for multilateral assistance by authorizing and appropriating funds for the international financial institutions these multilateral programs enhance the efficiency of us contributions by combining them with those of many other donor countries to promote development the proposed new world bank affiliate to increase energy output in developing countries offers particular promise all these types of aid benefit our longrun economic and political interests  progress was made on a number of economic issues in negotiations throughout the un system however in spite of lengthy efforts in the united nations agreement has not been reached on how to launch a process of global negotiations in which nations might collectively work to solve such important issues as energy food protectionism and population pressures the united states continues to believe that progress can best be made when nations focus on such specific problems rather than on procedural and institutional questions it will continue to work to move the northsouth dialogue into a more constructive phase  foodthe war on hunger  the war on hunger must be a continuous urgent priority major portions of the worlds population continue to be threatened by the specter of hunger and malnutrition during the past year some 150 million people in 36 african countries were faced with near disaster as the result of serious drought induced food shortages our government working in concert with the uns food and agricultural organization fao helped to respond to that need but the problems of hunger cannot be solved by shortterm measures we must continue to support those activities bilateral and multilateral which aim at improving food production especially in developing countries and assuring global food security these measures are necessary to the maintenance of a stable and healthy world economy  i am pleased that negotiation of a new food aid convention which guarantees a minimum annual level of food assistance was successfully concluded in march the establishment of the international emergency wheat reserve will enable the us to meet its commitment under the new convention to feed hungry people even in times of short supply  of immediate concern is the prospect of millions of africans threatened by famine because of drought and civil disturbances the us plea for increased food aid resulted in the organization of an international pledging conference and we are hopeful that widespread starvation will be avoided  good progress has been made since the venice economic summit called for increased effort on this front we and other donor countries have begun to assist poor countries develop longterm strategies to improve their food production the world bank will invest up to 4 billion in the next few years in improving the grain storage and foodhandling capacity of countries prone to food shortages  good progress has been made since the tokyo economic summit called for increased effort on this front the world bank is giving this problem top priority as are some other donor countries the resources of the consultative group on international agricultural research will be doubled over a fiveyear period the work of our own institute of scientific and technological cooperation will further strengthen the search for relevant new agricultural technologies  the goal of freeing the world from hunger by the year 2000 should command the full support of all countries  the human dimension of foreign policy  human rights  the human rights policy of the united states has been an integral part of our overall foreign policy for the past several years this policy serves the national interest of the united states in several important ways by encouraging respect by governments for the basic rights of human beings it promotes peaceful constructive change reduces the likelihood of internal pressures for violent change and for the exploitation of these by our adversaries and thus directly serves our longterm interest in peace and stability by matching espousal of fundamental american principles of freedom with specific foreign policy actions we stand out in vivid contrast to our ideological adversaries by our efforts to expand freedom elsewhere we render our own freedom and our own nation more secure countries that respect human rights make stronger allies and better friends  rather than attempt to dictate what system of government or institutions other countries should have the us supports throughout the world the internationally recognized human rights which all members of the united nations have pledged themselves to respect there is more than one model that can satisfy the continuing human reach for freedom and justice  1980 has been a year of some disappointments but has also seen some positive developments in the ongoing struggle for fulfillment of human rights throughout the world in the year we have seen  free elections were held and democratic governments installed in peru dominica and jamaica honduras held a free election for installation of a constituent assembly an interim government was subsequently named pointing toward national presidential elections in 1981 brazil continues on its course of political liberalization  the charter of conduct signed in riobamba ecuador by ecuador colombia venezuela peru costa rica panama and spain affirms the importance of democracy and human rights for the andean countries  the organization of american states in its annual general assembly approved a resolution in support of the interamerican human rights commissions work the resolution took note of the commissions annual report which described the status of human rights in chile el salvador paraguay and uruguay and the special reports on argentina and haiti which described human rights conditions as investigated during onsite inspections to these countries  the awarding of the nobel prize for peace to adolfo perez esquivel of argentina for his nonviolent advocacy of human rights  the united states was able to rejoin the international labor organization after an absence of two years as that un body reformed its procedures to return to its original purpose of strengthening employeremployeegovernment relations to insure human rights for the working people of the world  the united states of course cannot take credit for all these various developments but we can take satisfaction in knowing that our policies encourage and perhaps influence them  those who see a contradiction between our security and our humanitarian interests forget that the basis for a secure and stable society is the bond of trust between a government and its people i profoundly believe that the future of our world is not to be found in authoritarianism that wears the mask of order or totalitarianism that wears the mask of justice instead let us find our future in the human face of democracy the human voice of individual liberty the human hand of economic development  humanitarian aid  the united states has continued to play its traditional role of safehaven for those who flee or are forced to flee their homes because of persecution or war during 1980 the united states provided resettlement opportunities for 216000 refugees from countries around the globe in addition the united states joined with other nations to provide relief to refugees in country of first asylum in africa the middle east and asia  the great majority of refugee admissions continued to be from indochina during 1980 168000 indochinese were resettled in the united states although refugee populations persist in camps in southeast asia and refugees continue to flee vietnam laos and kampuchea the flow is not as great as in the past one factor in reducing the flow from vietnam has been the successful negotiation and commencement of an orderly departure program which permits us to process vietnamese for resettlement in the united states with direct departure from ho chi minh ville in an orderly fashion the first group of 250 departed vietnam for the united states in december 1980  in addition to the refugees admitted last year the united states accepted for entry into the united states 125000 cubans who were expelled by fidel castro federal and state authorities as well as private voluntary agencies responded with unprecedented vigor to coping with the unexpected influx of cubans  major relief efforts to aid refugees in countries of first asylum continued in several areas of the world in december 1980 thirtytwo nations meeting in new york city agreed to contribute 65 million to the continuing famine relief program in kampuchea due in great part to the generosity of the american people and the leadership exercised in the international arena by the united states we have played the pivotal role in ameliorating massive suffering in kampuchea  the united states has taken the lead among a group of donor countries who are providing relief to some two million refugees in the horn of africa who have been displaced by fighting in ethiopia us assistance primarily to somalia consists of 35 million worth of food and 18 million in cash and kind here again united states efforts can in large part be credited with keeping hundreds of thousands of people alive  another major international relief effort has been mounted in pakistan the united states is one of 25 countries plus the european economic community who have been helping the government of pakistan to cope with the problem of feeding and sheltering the more than one million refugees that have been generated by the soviet invasion of afghanistan  in april 1980 the congress passed the refugee act of 1980 which brought together for the first time in one piece of legislation the various threads of us policy towards refugees the law laid down a new broader definition of the term refugee established mechanisms for arriving at a level of refugee admissions through consultation with congress and established the office of the united states coordinator for refugees  it cannot be ignored that the destructive and aggressive policies of the soviet union have added immeasurably to the suffering in these three tragic situations  the control of nuclear weapons  together with our friends and allies we are striving to build a world in which peoples with diverse interests can live freely and prosper but all that humankind has achieved to date all that we are seeking to accomplish and human existence itself can be undone in an instantin the catastrophe of a nuclear war  thus one of the central objectives of my administration has been to control the proliferation of nuclear weapons to those nations which do not have them and their further development by the existing nuclear powers notably the soviet union and the united states  nonproliferation  my administration has been committed to stemming the spread of nuclear weapons nuclear proliferation would raise the spectre of the use of nuclear explosives in crucial unstable regions of the world endangering not only our security and that of our allies but that of the whole world nonproliferation is not and can not be a unilateral us policy nor should it be an issue of contention between the industrialized and developing states the international nonproliferation effort requires the support of suppliers as well as importers of nuclear technology and materials  we have been proceeding on a number of fronts  first we have been seeking to encourage nations to accede to the nonproliferation treaty the us is also actively encouraging other nations to accept fullscope safeguards on all of their nuclear activities and is asking other nuclear suppliers to adopt a fullscope safeguards requirement as a condition for future supply  second the international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation infce which was completed in 1980 demonstrated that suppliers and recipients can work together on these technically complex and sensitive issues while differences remain the infce effort provides a broader international basis for national decisions which must balance energy needs with nonproliferation concerns  finally we are working to encourage regional cooperation and restraint protocol i of the treaty of tlatelolco which will contribute to the lessening of nuclear dangers for our latin american neighbors ought now to be ratified by the united states senate  limitations on strategic arms  i remain convinced that the salt ii treaty is in our nations security interest and that it would add significantly to the control of nuclear weapons i strongly support continuation of the salt process and the negotiation of more farreaching mutual restraints on nuclear weaponry  conclusion  we have new support in the world for our purposes of national independence and individual human dignity we have a new will at home to do what is required to keep us the strongest nation on earth  we must move together into this decade with the strength which comes from realization of the dangers before us and from the confidence that together we can overcome them  the white house january 16 1981  
190, State of the Union Address, Ronald Reagan,1982-01-26,  mr speaker mr president distinguished members of the congress honored guests and fellow citizens  today marks my first state of the union address to you a constitutional duty as old as our republic itself  president washington began this tradition in 1790 after reminding the nation that the destiny of selfgovernment and the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty is finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people for our friends in the press who place a high premium on accuracy let me say i did not actually hear george washington say that but it is a matter of historic record  but from this podium winston churchill asked the free world to stand together against the onslaught of aggression franklin delano roosevelt spoke of a day of infamy and summoned a nation to arms douglas macarthur made an unforgettable farewell to a country he loved and served so well dwight eisenhower reminded us that peace was purchased only at the price of strength and john f kennedy spoke of the burden and glory that is freedom  when i visited this chamber last year as a newcomer to washington critical of past policies which i believed had failed i proposed a new spirit of partnership between this congress and this administration and between washington and our state and local governments in forging this new partnership for america we could achieve the oldest hopes of our republicprosperity for our nation peace for the world and the blessings of individual liberty for our children and someday for all of humanity  its my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made in our relations with other nations on the foundation weve carefully laid for our economic recovery and finally on a bold and spirited initiative that i believe can change the face of american government and make it again the servant of the people  seldom have the stakes been higher for america what we do and say here will make all the difference to autoworkers in detroit lumberjacks in the northwest steelworkers in steubenville who are in the unemployment lines to black teenagers in newark and chicago to hardpressed farmers and small businessmen and to millions of everyday americans who harbor the simple wish of a safe and financially secure future for their children to understand the state of the union we must look not only at where we are and where were going but where weve been the situation at this time last year was truly ominous  the last decade has seen a series of recessions there was a recession in 1970 in 1974 and again in the spring of 1980 each time unemployment increased and inflation soon turned up again we coined the word stagflation to describe this  governments response to these recessions was to pump up the money supply and increase spending in the last 6 months of 1980 as an example the money supply increased at the fastest rate in postwar history13 percent inflation remained in double digits and government spending increased at an annual rate of 17 percent interest rates reached a staggering 215 percent there were 8 million unemployed  late in 1981 we sank into the present recession largely because continued high interest rates hurt the auto industry and construction and there was a drop in productivity and the already high unemployment increased  this time however things are different we have an economic program in place completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past it calls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending and already that rate has been cut nearly in half but reduced spending the first and smallest phase of a 3year tax rate reduction designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs already interest rates are down to 15 34 percent but they must still go lower inflation is down from 124 percent to 89 and for the month of december it was running at an annualized rate of 52 percent if we had not acted as we did things would be far worse for all americans than they are today inflation taxes and interest rates would all be higher  a year ago americans faith in their governmental process was steadily declining six out of 10 americans were saying they were pessimistic about their future a new kind of defeatism was heard some said our domestic problems were uncontrollable that we had to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment  there were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between our administration and this congress it was said we could never work together well those predictions were wrong the record is clear and i believe that history will remember this as an era of american renewal remember this administration as an administration of change and remember this congress as a congress of destiny  together we not only cut the increase in government spending nearly in half we brought about the largest tax reductions and the most sweeping changes in our tax structure since the beginning of this century and because we indexed future taxes to the rate of inflation we took away governments builtin profit on inflation and its hidden incentive to grow larger at the expense of american workers  together after 50 years of taking power away from the hands of the people in their states and local communities we have started returning power and resources to them  together we have cut the growth of new federal regulations nearly in half in 1981 there were 23000 fewer pages in the federal register which lists new regulations than there were in 1980 by deregulating oil weve come closer to achieving energy independence and helped bring down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel  together we have created an effective federal strike force to combat waste and fraud in government in just 6 months it has saved the taxpayers more than 2 billion and its only getting started  together weve begun to mobilize the private sector not to duplicate wasteful and discredited government programs but to bring thousands of americans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of americas social problems  together weve begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensures peace our countrys uniform is being worn once again with pride  together we have made a new beginning but we have only begun  no one pretends that the way ahead will be easy in my inaugural address last year i warned that the ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades they will not go away in days weeks or months but they will go away    because we as americans have the capacity now as weve had it in the past to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom  the economy will face difficult moments in the months ahead but the program for economic recovery that is in place will pull the economy out of its slump and put us on the road to prosperity and stable growth by the latter half of this year and that is why i can report to you tonight that in the near future the state of the union and the economy will be bettermuch betterif we summon the strength to continue on the course that weve charted  and so the question if the fundamentals are in place what now well two things first we must understand whats happening at the moment to the economy our current problems are not the product of the recovery program thats only just now getting underway as some would have you believe they are the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend and spend  second because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will not respond to quick political fixes we must stick to our carefully integrated plan for recovery that plan is based on four commonsense fundamentals continued reduction of the growth in federal spending preserving the individual and business tax reductions that will stimulate saving and investment removing unnecessary federal regulations to spark productivity and maintaining a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy the latter a responsibility of the federal reserve system  the only alternative being offered to this economic program is a return to the policies that gave us a trilliondollar debt runaway inflation runaway interest rates and unemployment the doubters would have us turn back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax rate reductions already passed by this congress raise present taxes to cut future deficits they tell us well i dont believe we should buy that argument  there are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits or surpluses several years ahead with any degree of accuracy the budget in place when i took office had been projected as balanced it turned out to have one of the biggest deficits in history another example of the imponderables that can make deficit projections highly questionablea change of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit up or down by some 25 billion  as it now stands our forecast which were required by law to make will show major deficits starting at less than a hundred billion dollars and declining but still too high more important were making progress with the three keys to reducing deficits economic growth lower interest rates and spending control the policies we have in place will reduce the deficit steadily surely and in time completely  higher taxes would not mean lower deficits if they did how would we explain that tax revenues more than doubled just since 1976 yet in that same 6year period we ran the largest series of deficits in our history in 1980 tax revenues increased by 54 billion and in 1980 we had one of our alltime biggest deficits raising taxes wont balance the budget it will encourage more government spending and less private investment raising taxes will slow economic growth reduce production and destroy future jobs making it more difficult for those without jobs to find them and more likely that those who now have jobs could lose them so i will not ask you to try to balance the budget on the backs of the american taxpayers  i will seek no tax increases this year and i have no intention of retreating from our basic program of tax relief i promise to bring the american peopleto bring their tax rates down and to keep them down to provide them incentives to rebuild our economy to save to invest in americas future i will stand by my word tonight im urging the american people seize these new opportunities to produce to save to invest and together well make this economy a mighty engine of freedom hope and prosperity again  now the budget deficit this year will exceed our earlier expectations the recession did that it lowered revenues and increased costs to some extent were also victims of our own success weve brought inflation down faster than we thought we could and in doing this weve deprived government of those hidden revenues that occur when inflation pushes people into higher income tax brackets and the continued high interest rates last year cost the government about 5 billion more than anticipated  we must cut out more nonessential government spending and rout out more waste and we will continue our efforts to reduce the number of employees in the federal work force by 75000  the budget plan i submit to you on february 8th will realize major savings by dismantling the departments of energy and education and by eliminating ineffective subsidies for business well continue to redirect our resources to our two highest budget prioritiesa strong national defense to keep america free and at peace and a reliable safety net of social programs for those who have contributed and those who are in need  contrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard this administration has not and will not turn its back on americas elderly or americas poor under the new budget funding for social insurance programs will be more than double the amount spent only 6 years ago but it would be foolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made more efficient and economical  the entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needy have worthy goals and many deserving recipients we will protect them but theres only one way to see to it that these programs really help those whom they were designed to help and that is to bring their spiraling costs under control  today we face the absurd situation of a federal budget with threequarters of its expenditures routinely referred to as uncontrollable and a large part of this goes to entitlement programs  committee after committee of this congress has heard witness after witness describe many of these programs as poorly administered and rife with waste and fraud virtually every american who shops in a local supermarket is aware of the daily abuses that take place in the food stamp program which has grown by 16000 percent in the last 15 years another example is medicare and medicaidprograms with worthy goals but whose costs have increased from 112 billion to almost 60 billion more than 5 times as much in just 10 years  waste and fraud are serious problems back in 1980 federal investigators testified before one of your committees that corruption has permeated virtually every area of the medicare and medicaid health care industry one official said many of the people who are cheating the system were very confident that nothing was going to happen to them well something is going to happen not only the taxpayers are defrauded the people with real dependency on these programs are deprived of what they need because available resources are going not to the needy but to the greedy  the time has come to control the uncontrollable in august we made a start i signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by 44 billion over the next 3 years while at the same time preserving essential services for the truly needy shortly you will receive from me a message on further reforms we intend to installsome new but others long recommended by your own congressional committees i ask you to help make these savings for the american taxpayer  the savings we propose in entitlement programs will total some 63 billion over 4 years and will without affecting social t security go a long way toward bringing federal spending under control  but dont be fooled by those who proclaim that spending cuts will deprive the elderly the needy and the helpless the federal government will still subsidize 95 million meals every day thats one out of seven of all the meals served in america head start senior nutrition programs and child welfare programs will not be cut from the levels we proposed last year more than onehalf billion dollars has been proposed for minority business assistance and research at the national institute of health will be increased by over 100 million while meeting all these needs we intend to plug unwarranted tax loopholes and strengthen the law which requires all large corporations to pay a minimum tax  i am confident the economic program weve put into operation will protect the needy while it triggers a recovery that will benefit all americans it will stimulate the economy result in increased savings and provide capital for expansion mortgages for homebuilding and jobs for the unemployed  now that the essentials of that program are in place our next major undertaking must be a programjust as bold just as innovativeto make government again accountable to the people to make our system of federalism work again  our citizens feel theyve lost control of even the most basic decisions made about the essential services of government such as schools welfare roads and even garbage collection and theyre right a maze of interlocking jurisdictions and levels of government confronts average citizens in trying to solve even the simplest of problems they dont know where to turn for answers who to hold accountable who to praise who to blame who to vote for or against the main reason for this is the overpowering growth of federal grantsinaid programs during the past few decades  in 1960 the federal government had 132 categorical grant programs costing 7 billion when i took office there were approximately 500 costing nearly a hundred billion dollars13 programs for energy 36 for pollution control 66 for social services 90 for education and here in the congress it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track of them  you know and i know that neither the president nor the congress can properly oversee this jungle of grantsinaid indeed the growth of these grants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government as one democratic governor put it recently the national government should be worrying about arms control not potholes  the growth in these federal programs hasin the words of one intergovernmental commissionmade the federal government more pervasive more intrusive more unmanageable more ineffective and costly and above all more un accountable lets solve this problem with a single bold stroke the return of some 47 billion in federal programs to state and local government together with the means to finance them and a transition period of nearly 10 years to avoid unnecessary disruption  i will shortly send this congress a message describing this program i want to emphasize however that its full details will have been worked out only after close consultation with congressional state and local officials  starting in fiscal 1984 the federal government will assume full responsibility for the cost of the rapidly growing medicaid program to go along with its existing responsibility for medicare as part of a financially equal swap the states will simultaneously take full responsibility for aid to families with dependent children and food stamps this will make welfare less costly and more responsive to genuine need because itll be designed and administered closer to the grass roots and the people it serves  in 1984 the federal government will apply the full proceeds from certain excise taxes to a grass roots trust fund that will belong in fair shares to the 50 states the total amount flowing into this fund will be 28 billion a year over the next 4 years the states can use this money in either of two ways if they want to continue receiving federal grants in such areas as transportation education and social services they can use their trust fund money to pay for the grants or to the extent they choose to forgo the federal grant programs they can use their trust fund money on their own for those or other purposes there will be a mandatory passthrough of part of these funds to local governments  by 1988 the states will be in complete control of over 40 federal grant programs the trust fund will start to phase out eventually to disappear and the excise taxes will be turned over to the states they can then preserve lower or raise taxes on their own and fund and manage these programs as they see fit  in a single stroke we will be accomplishing a realignment that will end cumbersome administration and spiraling costs at the federal level while we ensure these programs will be more responsive to both the people theyre meant to help and the people who pay for them  hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility of state and local governments were proposing legislation for an experimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban areas in the 1980s and 90s this legislation will permit states and localities to apply to the federal government for designation as urban enterprise zones a broad range of special economic incentives in the zones will help attract new business new jobs new opportunity to americas inner cities and rural towns some will say our mission is to save free enterprise well i say we must free enterprise so that together we can save america  some will also say our states and local communities are not up to the challenge of a new and creative partnership well that might have been true 20 years ago before reforms like reapportionment and the voting rights act the 10year extension of which i strongly support its no longer true today this administration has faith in state and local governments and the constitutional balance envisioned by the founding fathers we also believe in the integrity decency and sound good sense of grass roots americans  our faith in the american people is reflected in another major endeavor our private sector initiatives task force is seeking out successful community models of school church business union foundation and civic programs that help community needs such groups are almost invariably far more efficient than government in running social programs  were not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited government programs dollar for dollar service for service we just want to help them perform the good works they choose and help others to profit by their example three hundred and eightyfive thousand corporations and private organizations are already working on social programs ranging from drug rehabilitation to job training and thousands more americans have written us asking how they can help the volunteer spirit is still alive and well in america  our nations long journey towards civil rights for all our citizensonce a source of discord now a source of pridemust continue with no backsliding or slowing down we must and shall see that those basic laws that guarantee equal rights are preserved and when necessary strengthened  our concern for equal rights for women is firm and unshakable we launched a new task force on legal equity for women and a fifty states project that will examine state laws for discriminatory language and for the first time in our history a woman sits on the highest court in the land  so too the problem of crimeone as real and deadly serious as any in america today it demands that we seek transformation of our legal system which overly protects the rights of criminals while it leaves society and the innocent victims of crime without justice  we look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase jobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air were encouraged by the bipartisan initiative of the house and are hopeful of further progress as the senate continues its deliberations  so far ive concentrated largely now on domestic matters to view the state of the union in perspective we must not ignore the rest of the world there isnt time tonight for a lengthy treatment of socialor foreign policy i should say a subject i intend to address in detail in the near future a few words however are in order on the progress weve made over the past year reestablishing respect for our nation around the globe and some of the challenges and goals that we will approach in the year ahead  at ottawa and cancun i met with leaders of the major industrial powers and developing nations now some of those i met with were a little surprised that i didnt apologize for americas wealth instead i spoke of the strength of the free marketplace system and how that system could help them realize their aspirations for economic development and political freedom i believe lasting friendships were made and the foundation was laid for future cooperation  in the vital region of the caribbean basin were developing a program of aid trade and investment incentives to promote selfsustaining growth and a better more secure life for our neighbors to the south toward those who would export terrorism and subversion in the caribbean and elsewhere especially cuba and libya we will act with firmness  our foreign policy is a policy of strength fairness and balance by restoring americas military credibility by pursuing peace at the negotiating table wherever both sides are willing to sit down in good faith and by regaining the respect of americas allies and adversaries alike we have strengthened our countrys position as a force for peace and progress in the world  when action is called for were taking it our sanctions against the military dictatorship that has attempted to crush human rights in polandand against the soviet regime behind that military dictatorshipclearly demonstrated to the world that america will not conduct business as usual with the forces of oppression if the events in poland continue to deteriorate further measures will follow  now let me also note that private american groups have taken the lead in making january 30th a day of solidarity with the people of poland so too the european parliament has called for march 21st to be an international day of support for afghanistan well i urge all peaceloving peoples to join together on those days to raise their voices to speak and pray for freedom  meanwhile were working for reduction of arms and military activities as i announced in my address to the nation last november 18th we have proposed to the soviet union a farreaching agenda for mutual reduction of military forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in geneva on intermediaterange nuclear forces in those talks it is essential that we negotiate from a position of strength there must be a real incentive for the soviets to take these talks seriously this requires that we rebuild our defenses  in the last decade while we sought the moderation of soviet power through a process of restraint and accommodation the soviets engaged in an unrelenting buildup of their military forces the protection of our national security has required that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military forces  we have not neglected to strengthen our traditional alliances in europe and asia or to develop key relationships with our partners in the middle east and other countries building a more peaceful world requires a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up when radical forces threaten our friends when economic misfortune creates conditions of instability when strategically vital parts of the world fall under the shadow of soviet power our response can make the difference between peaceful change or disorder and violence thats why weve laid such stress not only on our own defense but on our vital foreign assistance program your recent passage of the foreign assistance act sent a signal to the world that america will not shrink from making the investments necessary for both peace and security our foreign policy must be rooted in realism not naivete or selfdelusion  a recognition of what the soviet empire is about is the starting point winston churchill in negotiating with the soviets observed that they respect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nations thats why weve moved to reconstruct our national defenses we intend to keep the peace we will also keep our freedom  we have made pledges of a new frankness in our public statements and worldwide broadcasts in the face of a climate of falsehood and misinformation weve promised the world a season of truththe truth of our great civilized ideas individual liberty representative government the rule of law under god weve never needed walls or minefields or barbed wire to keep our people in nor do we declare martial law to keep our people from voting for the kind of government they want  yes we have our problems yes were in a time of recession and its true theres no quick fix as i said to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment but we will end it the process has already begun and well see its effect as the year goes on  we speak with pride and admiration of that little band of americans who overcame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago but our glory didnt end with them americans ever since have emulated their deeds  we dont have to turn to our history books for heroes theyre all around us one who sits among you here tonight epitomized that heroism at the end of the longest imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our armed forces who will ever forget that night when we waited for television to bring us the scene of that first plane landing at clark field in the philippines bringing our pows home the plane door opened and jeremiah denton came slowly down the ramp he caught sight of our flag saluted it said god bless america and then thanked us for bringing him home  just 2 weeks ago in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the potomac we saw again the spirit of american heroism at its finestthe heroism of dedicated rescue workers saving crash victims from icy waters and we saw the heroism of one of our young government employees lenny skutnik who when he saw a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line dived into the water and dragged her to safety  and then there are countless quiet everyday heroes of american who sacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life than theyve known church and civic volunteers who help to feed clothe nurse and teach the needy millions whove made our nation and our nations destiny so very specialunsung heroes who may not have realized their own dreams themselves but then who reinvest those dreams in their children dont let anyone tell you that americas best days are behind her that the american spirit has been vanquished weve seen it triumph too often in our lives to stop believing in it now  a hundred and twenty years ago the greatest of all our presidents delivered his second state of the union message in this chamber we cannot escape history abraham lincoln warned we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves the trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest last generation  well that president and that congress did not fail the american people together they weathered the storm and preserved the union let it be said of us that we too did not fail that we too worked together to bring america through difficult times let us so conduct ourselves that two centuries from now another congress and another president meeting in this chamber as we are meeting will speak of us with pride saying that we met the test and preserved for them in their day the sacred flame of libertythis last best hope of man on earth  god bless you and thank you  note the president spoke at 9 pm in the house chamber at the capitol he was introduced by thomas p oneill jr speaker of the house of representatives the address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television  
191, State of the Union Address, Ronald Reagan,1983-01-25,  mr speaker mr president distinguished members of the congress honored guests and fellow citizens  this solemn occasion marks the 196th time that a president of the united states has reported on the state of the union since george washington first did so in 1790 thats a lot of reports but theres no shortage of new things to say about the state of the union the very key to our success has been our ability foremost among nations to preserve our lasting values by making change work for us rather than against us  i would like to talk with you this evening about what we can do togethernot as republicans and democrats but as americansto make tomorrows america happy and prosperous at home strong and respected abroad and at peace in the world  as we gather here tonight the state of our union is strong but our economy is troubled for too many of our fellow citizensfarmers steel and auto workers lumbermen black teenagers working mothersthis is a painful period we must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an end it has fallen to us in our time to undo damage that was a long time in the making and to begin the hard but necessary task of building a better future for ourselves and our children  we have a long way to go but thanks to the courage patience and strength of our people america is on the mend  but let me give you just one important reason why i believe thisit involves many members of this body  just 10 days ago after months of debate and deadlock the bipartisan commission on social security accomplished the seemingly impossible social security as some of us had warned for so long faced disaster i myself have been talking about this problem for almost 30 years as 1983 began the system stood on the brink of bankruptcy a double victim of our economic ills first a decade of rampant inflation drained its reserves as we tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living then the recession and the sudden end of inflation withered the expanding wage base and increasing revenues the system needs to support the 36 million americans who depend on it  when the speaker of the house the senate majority leader and i performed the bipartisanor formed the bipartisan commission on social security pundits and experts predicted that party divisions and conflicting interests would prevent the commission from agreeing on a plan to save social security well sometimes even here in washington the cynics are wrong through compromise and cooperation the members of the commission overcame their differences and achieved a fair workable plan they proved that when it comes to the national welfare americans can still pull together for the common good  tonight im especially pleased to join with the speaker and the senate majority leader in urging the congress to enact this plan by easter  there are elements in it of course that none of us prefers but taken together it performs a package that all of us can support it asks for some sacrifice by allthe selfemployed beneficiaries workers government employees and the betteroff among the retiredbut it imposes an undue burden on none and in supporting it we keep an important pledge to the american people the integrity of the social security system will be preserved and no ones payments will be reduced  the commissions plan will do the job indeed it must do the job we owe it to todays older americans and todays younger workers so before we go any further i ask you to join with me in saluting the members of the commission who are here tonight and senate majority leader howard baker and speaker tip oneill for a job well done i hope and pray the bipartisan spirit that guided you in this endeavor will inspire all of us as we face the challenges of the year ahead  nearly half a century ago in this chamber another american president franklin delano roosevelt in his second state of the union message urged america to look to the future to meet the challenge of change and the need for leadership that looks forward not backward  throughout the world he said change is the order of the day in every nation economic problems long in the making have brought crises to of many kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory were unprepared he also reminded us that the future lies with those wise political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in government than in politics  so let us in these next 2 yearsmen and women of both parties every political shadeconcentrate on the longrange bipartisan responsibilities of government not the shortrange or shortterm temptations of partisan politics  the problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of government had expected the recession was deeper than most inside and out of government had predicted curing those problems has taken more time and a higher toll than any of us wanted unemployment is far too high projected federal spendingif government refuses to tighten its own beltwill also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economic recovery now underway  this recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and spending for consumer items and capital goodsthe stimulus we need to restart our stalled economic engines the american people have already stepped up their rate of saving assuring that the funds needed to modernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow to business and industry  the inflationary expectations that led to a 21 12percent interest prime rate and soaring mortgage rates 2 years ago are now reduced by almost half leaders have started to realize that doubledigit inflation is no longer a way of life i misspoke there i should have said lenders  so interest rates have tumbled paving the way for recovery in vital industries like housing and autos  the early evidence of that recovery has started coming in housing starts for the fourth quarter of 1982 were up 45 percent from a year ago and housing permits a sure indicator of future growth were up a whopping 60 percent  were witnessing an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that american industry will once again become competitive in markets at home and abroad ensuring more jobs and better incomes for the nations work force but our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience quick fixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are what brought us the inflationary disorders that weve now paid such a heavy price to cure  the permanent recovery in employment production and investment we seek wont come in a sharp short spurt itll build carefully and steadily in the months and years ahead in the meantime the challenge of government is to identify the things that we can do now to ease the massive economic transition for the american people  the federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending we could face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion dollars more in national debt in the next 4 years alone that would average 4300 in additional debt for every man woman child and baby in our nation  to assure a sustained recovery we must continue getting runaway spending under control to bring those deficits down if we dont the recovery will be too short unemployment will remain too high and we will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our children that we must not do  lets be clear about where the deficit problem comes from contrary to the drumbeat weve been hearing for the last few months the deficits we face are not rooted in defense spending taken as a percentage of the gross national product our defense spending happens to be only about fourfifths of what it was in 1970 nor is the deficit as some would have it rooted in tax cuts even with our tax cuts taxes as a fraction of gross national product remain about the same as they were in 1970 the fact is our deficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spending  during the 1970s the share of our national income devoted to this domestic spending increased by more than 60 percent from 10 cents out of every dollar produced by the american people to 16 cents in spite of all our economies and efficiencies and without adding any new programs basic necessary domestic spending provided for in this years budget will grow to almost a trillion dollars over the next 5 years  the deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of our republic we need a plan to overcome this dangera plan based on these principles it must be bipartisan conquering the deficits and putting the governments house in order will require the best effort of all of us it must be fair just as all will share in the benefits that will come from recovery all would share fairly in the burden of transition it must be prudent the strength of our national defense must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy and finally it must be realistic we cant rely on hope alone  with these guiding principles in mind let me outline a fourpart plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficits  first in my budget message i will recommend a federal spending freeze i know this is strong medicine but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spending the government has continued to spend more money each year though not as much more as it did in the past taken as a whole the budget im proposing for the fiscal year will increase no more than the rate of inflation in other words the federal government will hold the line on real spending now thats far less than many american families have had to do in these difficult times  i will request that the proposed 6month freeze in costofliving adjustments recommended by the bipartisan social security commission be applied to other governmentrelated retirement programs i will also propose a 1year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs and for federal civilian and military pay and pension programs and let me say right here im sorry with regard to the military in asking that of them because for so many years they have been so far behind and so low in reward for what the men and women in uniform are doing but im sure they will understand that this must be across the board and fair  second i will ask the congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the socalled uncontrollable spending programs these are the automatic spending programs such as food stamps that cannot be simply frozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970 they are the largest single cause of the builtin or structural deficit problem our standard here will be fairness ensuring that the taxpayers hardearned dollars go only to the truly needy that none of them are turned away but that fraud and waste are stamped out and im sorry to say theres a lot of it out there in the food stamp program alone last year we identified almost 11 billion in overpayments the taxpayers arent the only victims of this kind of abuse the truly needy suffer as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy but by the greedy for everyones sake we must put an end to such waste and corruption  third i will adjust our program to restore americas defenses by proposing 55 billion in defense savings over the next 5 years these are savings recommended to me by the secretary of defense who has assured me they can be safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arms reductions or endanger americas security we will not gamble with our national survival  and fourth because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of deficits over the next several years i will propose a standby tax limited to no more than 1 percent of the gross national product to start in fiscal 1986 it would last no more than 3 years and it would start only if the congress has first approved our spending freeze and budget control program and there are several other conditions also that must be met all of them in order for this program to be triggered  now you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future a remedy that will be at hand if needed but only resorted to if absolutely necessary in the meantime well continue to study ways to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all americans this is a goal that every american whos ever struggled with a tax form can understand  at the same time however i will oppose any efforts to undo the basic tax reforms that weve already enacted including the 10percent tax break coming to taxpayers this july and the tax indexing which will protect all americans from inflationary bracket creep in the years ahead  now i realize that this fourpart plan is easier to describe than it will be to enact but the looming deficits that hang over us and over americas future must be reduced the path ive outlined is fair balanced and realistic if enacted it will ensure a steady decline in deficits aiming toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade its the only path that will lead to a strong sustained recovery let us follow that path together  no domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable permanent jobs for all americans who want to work the recovery program will provide jobs for most but others will need special help and training for new skills shortly i will submit to the congress the employment act of 1983 designed to get at the special problems of the longterm unemployed as well as young people trying to enter the job market ill propose extending unemployment benefits including special incentives to employers who hire the longterm unemployed providing programs for displaced workers and helping federally funded and stateadministered unemployment insurance programs provide workers with training and relocation assistance finally our proposal will include new incentives for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market  we must offer both shortterm help and longterm hope for our unemployed i hope we can work together on this i hope we can work together as we did last year in enacting the landmark job training partnership act regulatory reform legislation a responsible clean air act and passage of enterprise zone legislation will also create new incentives for jobs and opportunity  one of out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade so i will propose a broader strategy in the field of international tradeone that increases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to americas farmers and workers in the world marketplace we must have adequate export financing to sell american products overseas i will ask for new negotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our products into foreign markets we must strengthen the organization of our trade agencies and make changes in our domestic laws and international trade policy to promote free trade and the increased flow of american goods services and investments  our trade position can also be improved by making our port system more efficient better more active harbors translate into stable jobs in our coalfields railroads trucking industry and ports after 2 years of debate its time for us to get together and enact a port modernization bill  education training and retraining are fundamental to our success as are research and development and productivity labor management and government at all levels can and must participate in improving these tools of growth tax policy regulatory practices and government programs all need constant reevaluation in terms of our competitiveness every american has a role and a stake in international trade  we americans are still the technological leaders in most fields we must keep that edge and to do so we need to begin renewing the basicsstarting with our educational system while we grew complacent others have acted japan with a population only about half the size of ours graduates from its universities more engineers than we do if a child doesnt receive adequate math and science teaching by the age of 16 he or she has lost the chance to be a scientist or an engineer we must join togetherparents teachers grass roots groups organized labor and the business communityto revitalize american education by setting a standard of excellence  in 1983 we seek four major education goals a quality education initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction through block grants to the states establishment of education savings accounts that will give middle and lowerincome families an incentive to save for their childrens college education and at the same time encourage a real increase in savings for economic growth passage of tuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to private or religiously affiliated schools a constitutional amendment to permit voluntary school prayer god should never have been expelled from americas classrooms in the first place  our commitment to fairness means that we must assure legal and economic equity for women and eliminate once and for all all traces of unjust discrimination against women from the united states code we will not tolerate wage discrimination based on sex and we intend to strengthen enforcement of child support laws to ensure that single parents most of whom are women do not suffer unfair financial hardship we will also take action to remedy inequities in pensions these initiatives will be joined by others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women  also in the area of fairness and equity we will ask for extension of the civil rights commission which is due to expire this year the commission is an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in america and we strongly support its reauthorization effective enforcement of our nations fair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity in the year ahead well work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws for all americans  the time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking its high time that we make our cities safe again this administration hereby declares an allout war on bigtime organized crime and the drug racketeers who are poisoning our young people we will also implement recommendations of our task force on victims of crime which will report to me this week  american agriculture the envy of the world has become the victim of its own successes with one farmer now producing enough food to feed himself and 77 other people america is confronted with record surplus crops and commodity prices below the cost of production we must strive through innovations like the paymentinkind crop swap approach and an aggressive export policy to restore health and vitality to rural america meanwhile i have instructed the department of agriculture to work individually with farmers with debt problems to help them through these tough times  over the past year our task force on private sector initiatives has successfully forged a working partnership involving leaders of business labor education and government to address the training needs of american workers thanks to the task force private sector initiatives are now underway in all 50 states of the union and thousands of working people have been helped in making the shift from deadend jobs and lowdemand skills to the growth areas of high technology and the service economy additionally a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansion of private community child care the new advisory council on private sector initiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging private initiative in 1983  in the coming year we will also act to improve the quality of life for americans by curbing the skyrocketing cost of health care that is becoming an unbearable financial burden for so many and we will submit legislation to provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older americans  i will also shortly submit a comprehensive federalism proposal that will continue our efforts to restore to states and local governments their roles as dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society  during the next several weeks i will send to the congress a series of detailed proposals on these and other topics and look forward to working with you on the development of these initiatives  so far now ive concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the future but in almost every home and workplace in america were already witnessing reason for great hopethe first flowering of the manmade miracles of high technology a field pioneered and still led by our country  to many of us now computers silicon chips data processing cybernetics and all the other innovations of the dawning high technology age are as mystifying as the workings of the combustion engine must have been when that first model t rattled down main street usa but as surely as americas pioneer spirit made us the industrial giant of the 20th century the same pioneer spirit today is opening up on another vast front of opportunity the frontier of high technology  in conquering the frontier we cannot write off our traditional industries but we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneer of tomorrow this administration is committed to keeping america the technological leader of the world now and into the 21st century  but let us turn briefly to the international arena americas leadership in the world came to us because of our own strength and because of the values which guide us as a society free elections a free press freedom of religious choice free trade unions and above all freedom for the individual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state these values are the bedrock of our strength they unite us in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our allies and friends in nato in asia in latin america and elsewhere they are also the values which in the recent past some among us had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye  fortunately we and our allies have rediscovered the strength of our common democratic values and were applying them as a cornerstone of a comprehensive strategy for peace with freedom in london last year i announced the commitment of the united states to developing the infrastructure of democracy throughout the world we intend to pursue this democratic initiative vigorously the future belongs not to governments and ideologies which oppress their peoples but to democratic systems of selfgovernment which encourage individual initiative and guarantee personal freedom  but our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based on strengtheconomic strength and military strength a strong american economy is essential to the wellbeing and security of our friends and allies the restoration of a strong healthy american economy has been and remains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy the progress ive been able to report to you tonight will i know be as warmly welcomed by the rest of the world as it is by the american people  we must also recognize that our own economic wellbeing is inextricably linked to the world economy we export over 20 percent of our industrial production and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export we will continue to work closely with the industrialized democracies of europe and japan and with the international monetary fund to ensure it has adequate resources to help bring the world economy back to strong noninflationary growth  as the leader of the west and as a country that has become great and rich because of economic freedom america must be an unrelenting advocate of free trade as some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism our strategy cannot be to follow them but to lead the way toward freer trade to this end in may of this year america will host an economic summit meeting in williamsburg virginia  as we begin our third year we have put in place a defense program that redeems the neglect of the past decade we have developed a realistic military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fails our armed forces are finally properly paid after years of neglect are well trained and becoming better equipped and supplied and the american uniform is once again worn with pride most of the major systems needed for modernizing our defenses are already underway and we will be addressing one key system the mx missile in consultation with the congress in a few months  americas foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship on realism strength full partnership in consultation with our allies and constructive negotiation with potential adversaries from the middle east to southern africa to geneva american diplomats are taking the initiative to make peace and lower arms levels we should be proud of our role as peacemakers  in the middle east last year the united states played the major role in ending the tragic fighting in lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of the plo from beirut  last september i outlined principles to carry on the peace process begun so promisingly at camp david all the people of the middle east should know that in the year ahead we will not flag in our efforts to build on that foundation to bring them the blessings of peace  in central america and the caribbean basin we are likewise engaged in a partnership for peace prosperity and democracy final passage of the remaining portions of our caribbean basin initiative which passed the house last year is one of this administrations top legislative priorities for 1983  the security and economic assistance policies of this administration in latin america and elsewhere are based on realism and represent a critical investment in the future of the human race this undertaking is a joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branches and im counting on the cooperation and statesmanship of the congress to help us meet this essential foreign policy goal  at the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the soviet union the past year saw a change in soviet leadership were prepared for a positive change in sovietamerican relations but the soviet union must show by deeds as well as words a sincere commitment to respect the rights and sovereignty of the family of nations responsible members of the world community do not threaten or invade their neighbors and they restrain their allies from aggression  for our part were vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations with the soviet union supported by our allies weve put forward draft agreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiable lower levels we insist on an equal balance of forces and given the overwhelming evidence of soviet violations of international treaties concerning chemical and biological weapons we also insist that any agreement we sign can and will be verifiable  in the case of intermediaterange nuclear forces we have proposed the complete elimination of the entire class of landbased missiles were also prepared to carefully explore serious soviet proposals at the same time let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving arms reductions  with firmness and dedication well continue to negotiate deep down the soviets must know its in their interest as well as ours to prevent a wasteful arms race and once they recognize our unshakable resolve to maintain adequate deterrence they will have every reason to join us in the search for greater security and major arms reductions when that moment comesand im confident that it willwe will have taken an important step toward a more peaceful future for all the worlds people  a very wise man bernard baruch once said that america has never forgotten the nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path our country is a special place because we americans have always been sustained through good times and bad by a noble visiona vision not only of what the world around us is today but what we as a free people can make it be tomorrow  were realists we solve our problems instead of ignoring them no matter how loud the chorus of despair around us but were also idealists for it was an ideal that brought our ancestors to these shores from every corner of the world  right now we need both realism and idealism millions of our neighbors are without work it is up to us to see they arent without hope this is a task for all of us and may i say americans have rallied to this cause proving once again that we are the most generous people on earth  we who are in government must take the lead in restoring the economy and here all that time i thought you were reading the paper  the single thingthe single thing that can start the wheels of industry turning again is further reduction of interest rates just another 1 or 2 points can mean tens of thousands of jobs  right now with inflation as low as it is 39 percent there is room for interest rates to come down only fear prevents their reduction a lender as we know must charge an interest rate that recovers the depreciated value of the dollars loaned and that depreciation is of course the amount of inflation today interest rates are based on fearfear that government will resort to measures as it has in the past that will send inflation zooming again  we who serve here in this capital must erase that fear by making it absolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation that together we will do only those things that will lead to lasting economic growth  yes the problems confronting us are large and forbidding and certainly no one can or should minimize the plight of millions of our friends and neighbors who are living in the bleak emptiness of unemployment but we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful  back over the years citizens like ourselves have gathered within these walls when our nation was threatened sometimes when its very existence was at stake always with courage and common sense they met the crises of their time and lived to see a stronger better and more prosperous country the present situation is no worse and in fact is not as bad as some of those they faced time and again they proved that there is nothing we americans cannot achieve as free men and women  yes we still have problemsplenty of them but its just plain wrongunjust to our country and unjust to our peopleto let those problems stand in the way of the most important truth of all america is on the mend  we owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them in every way we can no one can quarrel with that we must and do have compassion for all the victims of this economic crisis but the big story about america today is the way that millions of confident caring peoplethose extraordinary ordinary americans who never make the headlines and will never be interviewedare laying the foundation not just for recovery from our present problems but for a better tomorrow for all our people  from coast to coast on the job and in classrooms and laboratories at new construction sites and in churches and community groups neighbors are helping neighbors and theyve already begun the building the research the work and the giving that will make our country great again  i believe this because i believe in themin the strength of their hearts and minds in the commitment that each one of them brings to their daily lives be they high or humble the challenge for us in government is to be worthy of themto make government a help not a hindrance to our people in the challenging but promising days ahead  if we do that if we care what our children and our childrens children will say of us if we want them one day to be thankful for what we did here in these temples of freedom we will work together to make america better for our having been herenot just in this year or this decade but in the next century and beyond  thank you and god bless you  note the president spoke at 903 pm in the house chamber of the capitol he was introduced by thomas p oneill jr speaker of the house of representatives the address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television  
192, State of the Union Address, Ronald Reagan,1984-01-25,  mr speaker mr president distinguished members of the congress honored guests and fellow citizens  once again in keeping with timehonored tradition i have come to report to you on the state of the union and im pleased to report that america is much improved and theres good reason to believe that improvement will continue through the days to come  you and i have had some honest and open differences in the year past but they didnt keep us from joining hands in bipartisan cooperation to stop a long decline that had drained this nations spirit and eroded its health there is renewed energy and optimism throughout the land america is back standing tall looking to the eighties with courage confidence and hope  the problems were overcoming are not the heritage of one person party or even one generation its just the tendency of government to grow for practices and programs to become the nearest thing to eternal life well ever see on this earth and theres always that wellintentioned chorus of voices saying with a little more power and a little more money we could do so much for the people for a time we forgot the american dream isnt one of making government bigger its keeping faith with the mighty spirit of free people under god  as we came to the decade of the eighties we faced the worst crisis in our postwar history in the seventies were years of rising problems and falling confidence there was a feeling government had grown beyond the consent of the governed families felt helpless in the face of mounting inflation and the indignity of taxes that reduced reward for hard work thrift and risktaking all this was overlaid by an evergrowing web of rules and regulations  on the international scene we had an uncomfortable feeling that wed lost the respect of friend and foe some questioned whether we had the will to defend peace and freedom but america is too great for small dreams there was a hunger in the land for a spiritual revival if you will a crusade for renewal the american people said let us look to the future with confidence both at home and abroad let us give freedom a chance  americans were ready to make a new beginning and together we have done it were confronting our problems one by one hope is alive tonight for millions of young families and senior citizens set free from unfair tax increases and crushing inflation inflation has been beaten down from 124 to 32 percent and thats a great victory for all the people the prime rate has been cut almost in half and we must work together to bring it down even more  together we passed the first acrosstheboard tax reduction for everyone since the kennedy tax cuts next year tax rates will be indexed so inflation cant push people into higher brackets when they get costofliving pay raises government must never again use inflation to profit at the peoples expense  today a working family earning 25000 has 1100 more in purchasing power than if tax and inflation rates were still at the 1980 levels real aftertax income increased 5 percent last year and economic deregulation of key industries like transportation has offered more chancesor choices i should say to consumers and new changesor chances for entrepreneurs and protecting safety tonight we can report and be proud of one of the best recoveries in decades send away the handwringers and the doubting thomases hope is reborn for couples dreaming of owning homes and for risktakers with vision to create tomorrows opportunities  the spirit of enterprise is sparked by the sunrise industries of hightech and by small business people with big ideaspeople like barbara proctor who rose from a ghetto to build a multimilliondollar advertising agency in chicago carlos perez a cuban refugee who turned 27 and a dream into a successful importing business in coral gables florida  people like these are heroes for the eighties they helped 4 million americans find jobs in 1983 more people are drawing paychecks tonight than ever before and congress helpsor progress helps everyonewell congress does tooeveryone in 1983 women filled 73 percent of all the new jobs in managerial professional and technical fields  but we know that many of our fellow countrymen are still out of work wondering what will come of their hopes and dreams can we love america and not reach out to tell them you are not forgotten we will not rest until each of you can reach as high as your godgiven talents will take you  the heart of america is strong its good and true the cynics were wrong america never was a sick society were seeing rededication to bedrock values of faith family work neighborhood peace and freedomvalues that help bring us together as one people from the youngest child to the most senior citizen  the congress deserves americas thanks for helping us restore pride and credibility to our military and i hope that youre as proud as i am of the young men and women in uniform who have volunteered to man the ramparts in defense of freedom and whose dedication valor and skill increases so much our chance of living in a world at peace  people everywhere hunger for peace and a better life the tide of the future is a freedom tide and our struggle for democracy cannot and will not be denied this nation champions peace that enshrines liberty democratic rights and dignity for every individual americas new strength confidence and purpose are carrying hope and opportunity far from our shores a world economic recovery is underway it began here  weve journeyed far but we have much farther to go franklin roosevelt told us 50 years ago this month civilization can not go back civilization must not stand still we have undertaken new methods it is our task to perfect to improve to alter when necessary but in all cases to go forward  its time to move forward again time for america to take freedoms next step let us unite tonight behind four great goals to keep america free secure and at peace in the eighties together  we can ensure steady economic growth we can develop americas next frontier we can strengthen our traditional values and we can build a meaningful peace to protect our loved ones and this shining star of faith that has guided millions from tyranny to the safe harbor of freedom progress and hope  doing these things will open wider the gates of opportunity provide greater security for all with no barriers of bigotry or discrimination  the key to a dynamic decade is vigorous economic growth our first great goal we might well begin with common sense in federal budgeting government spending no more than government takes in  we must bring federal deficits down but how we do that makes all the difference  we can begin by limiting the size and scope of government under the leadership of vice president bush we have reduced the growth of federal regulations by more than 25 percent and cut well over 300 million hours of governmentrequired paperwork each year this will save the public more than 150 billion over the next 10 years  the grace commission has given us some 2500 recommendations for reducing wasteful spending and theyre being examined throughout the administration federal spending growth has been cut from 174 percent in 1980 to less than half of that today and we have already achieved over 300 billion in budget savings for the period of 1982 to 86 but thats only a little more than half of what we sought government is still spending too large a percentage of the total economy  now some insist that any further budget savings must be obtained by reducing the portion spent on defense this ignores the fact that national defense is solely the responsibility of the federal government indeed it is its prime responsibility and yet defense spending is less than a third of the total budget during the years of president kennedy and of the years before that defense was almost half the total budget and then came several years in which our military capability was allowed to deteriorate to a very dangerous degree we are just now restoring through the essential modernization of our conventional and strategic forces our capability to meet our present and future security needs we dare not shirk our responsibility to keep america free secure and at peace  the last decade saw domestic spending surge literally out of control but the basis for such spending had been laid in previous years a pattern of overspending has been in place for half a century as the national debt grew we were told not to worry that we owed it to ourselves  now we know that deficits are a cause for worry but theres a difference of opinion as to whether taxes should be increased spending cut or some of both fear is expressed that government borrowing to fund the deficit could inhibit the economic recovery by taking capital needed for business and industrial expansion well i think that debate is missing an important point whether government borrows or increases taxes it will be taking the same amount of money from the private sector and either way thats too much simple fairness dictates that government must not raise taxes on families struggling to pay their bills the root of the problem is that governments share is more than we can afford if were to have a sound economy  we must bring down the deficits to ensure continued economic growth in the budget that i will submit on february 1st i will recommend measures that will reduce the deficit over the next 5 years many of these will be unfinished business from last years budget  some could be enacted quickly if we could join in a serious effort to address this problem i spoke today with speaker of the house oneill senate majority leader baker senate minority leader byrd and house minority leader michel i asked them if they would designate congressional representatives to meet with representatives of the administration to try to reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction plan i know it would take a long hard struggle to agree on a fullscale plan so what i have proposed is that we first see if we can agree on a down payment  now i believe there is basis for such an agreement one that could reduce the deficits by about a hundred billion dollars over the next 3 years we could focus on some of the less contentious spending cuts that are still pending before the congress these could be combined with measures to close certain tax loopholes measures that the treasury department has previously said to be worthy of support in addition we could examine the possibility of achieving further outlay savings based on the work of the grace commission  if the congressional leadership is willing my representatives will be prepared to meet with theirs at the earliest possible time i would hope the leadership might agree on an expedited timetable in which to develop and enact that down payment  but a down payment alone is not enough to break us out of the deficit problem it could help us start on the right path yet we must do more so i propose that we begin exploring how together we can make structural reforms to curb the builtin growth of spending  i also propose improvements in the budgeting process some 43 of our 50 states grant their governors the right to veto individual items in appropriation bills without having to veto the entire bill california is one of those 43 states as governor i found this lineitem veto was a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending it works in 43 states lets put it to work in washington for all the people  it would be most effective if done by constitutional amendment the majority of americans approve of such an amendment just as they and i approve of an amendment mandating a balanced federal budget many states also have this protection in their constitutions  to talk of meeting the present situation by increasing taxes is a bandaid solution which does nothing to cure an illness thats been coming on for half a centuryto say nothing of the fact that it poses a real threat to economic recovery lets remember that a substantial amount of income tax is presently owed and not paid by people in the underground economy it would be immoral to make those who are paying taxes pay more to compensate for those who arent paying their share  theres a better way let us go forward with an historic reform for fairness simplicity and incentives for growth i am asking secretary don regan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code so all taxpayers big and small are treated more fairly and i believe such a plan could result in that underground economy being brought into the sunlight of honest tax compliance and it could make the tax base broader so personal tax rates could come down not go up ive asked that specific recommendations consistent with those objectives be presented to me by december 1984  our second great goal is to build on americas pioneer spiriti said something funny i said americas next frontierand thats to develop that frontier a sparkling economy spurs initiatives sunrise industries and makes older ones more competitive  nowhere is this more important than our next frontier space nowhere do we so effectively demonstrate our technological leadership and ability to make life better on earth the space age is barely a quarter of a century old but already weve pushed civilization forward with our advances in science and technology opportunities and jobs will multiply as we cross new thresholds of knowledge and reach deeper into the unknown  our progress in spacetaking giant steps for all mankindis a tribute to american teamwork and excellence our finest minds in government industry and academia have all pulled together and we can be proud to say we are first we are the best and we are so because were free  america has always been greatest when we dared to be great we can reach for greatness again we can follow our dreams to distant stars living and working in space for peaceful economic and scientific gain tonight i am directing nasa to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade  a space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science communications in metals and in lifesaving medicines which could be manufactured only in space we want our friends to help us meet these challenges and share in their benefits nasa will invite other countries to participate so we can strengthen peace build prosperity and expand freedom for all who share our goals  just as the oceans opened up a new world for clipper ships and yankee traders space holds enormous potential for commerce today the market for space transportation could surpass our capacity to develop it companies interested in putting payloads into space must have ready access to private sector launch services the department of transportation will help an expendable launch services industry to get off the ground well soon implement a number of executive initiatives develop proposals to ease regulatory constraints and with nasas help promote private sector investment in space  and as we develop the frontier of space let us remember our responsibility to preserve our older resources here on earth preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge its common sense  though this is a time of budget constraints i have requested for epa one of the largest percentage budget increases of any agency we will begin the long necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational area and a special national resourcethe chesapeake bay  to reduce the threat posed by abandoned hazardous waste dumps epa will spend 410 million and i will request a supplemental increase of 50 million and because the superfund law expires in 1985 ive asked bill ruckelshaus to develop a proposal for its extension so therell be additional time to complete this important task  on the question of acid rain which concerns people in many areas of the united states and canada im proposing a research program that doubles our current funding and well take additional action to restore our lakes and develop new technology to reduce pollution that causes acid rain  we have greatly improved the conditions of our natural resources well ask the congress for 157 million beginning in 1985 to acquire new park and conservation lands the department of the interior will encourage careful selective exploration and production on our vital resources in an exclusive economic zone within the 200mile limit off our coastsbut with strict adherence to environmental laws and with fuller state and public participation  but our most precious resources our greatest hope for the future are the minds and hearts of our people especially our children we can help them build tomorrow by strengthening our community of shared values this must be our third great goal for us faith work family neighborhood freedom and peace are not just words theyre expressions of what america means definitions of what makes us a good and loving people  families stand at the center of our society and every family has a personal stake in promoting excellence in education excellence does not begin in washington a 600percent increase in federal spending on education between 1960 and 1980 was accompanied by a steady decline in scholastic aptitude test scores excellence must begin in our homes and neighborhood schools where its the responsibility of every parent and teacher and the right of every child  our children come first and thats why i established a bipartisan national commission on excellence in education to help us chart a commonsense course for better education and already communities are implementing the commissions recommendations schools are reporting progress in math and reading skills but we must do more to restore discipline to schools and we must encourage the teaching of new basics reward teachers of merit enforce tougher standards and put our parents back in charge  i will continue to press for tuition tax credits to expand opportunities for families and to soften the double payment for those paying public school taxes and private school tuition our proposal would target assistance to low and middleincome families just as more incentives are needed within our schools greater competition is needed among our schools without standards and competition there can be no champions no records broken no excellence in education or any other walk of life  and while im on this subject each day your members observe a 200yearold tradition meant to signify america is one nation under god i must ask if you can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here leading you in prayer then why cant freedom to acknowledge god be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land  america was founded by people who believed that god was their rock of safety he is ours i recognize we must be cautious in claiming that god is on our side but i think its all right to keep asking if were on his side  during our first 3 years we have joined bipartisan efforts to restore protection of the law to unborn children now i know this issue is very controversial but unless and until it can be proven that an unborn child is not a living human being can we justify assuming without proof that it isnt no one has yet offered such proof indeed all the evidence is to the contrary we should rise above bitterness and reproach and if americans could come together in a spirit of understanding and helping then we could find positive solutions to the tragedy of abortion  economic recovery better education rededication to values all show the spirit of renewal gaining the upper hand and all will improve family life in the eighties but families need more they need assurance that they and their loved ones can walk the streets of america without being afraid parents need to know their children will not be victims of child pornography and abduction this year we will intensify our drive against these and other horrible crimes like sexual abuse and family violence  already our efforts to crack down on career criminals organized crime drugpushers and to enforce tougher sentences and paroles are having effect in 1982 the crime rate dropped by 43 percent the biggest decline since 1972 protecting victims is just as important as safeguarding the rights of defendants  opportunities for all americans will increase if we move forward in fair housing and work to ensure womens rights provide for equitable treatment in pension benefits and individual retirement accounts facilitate child care and enforce delinquent parent support payments  its not just the home but the workplace and community that sustain our values and shape our future so i ask your help in assisting more communities to break the bondage of dependency help us to free enterprise by permitting debate and voting yes on our proposal for enterprise zones in america this has been before you for 2 years its passage can help highunemployment areas by creating jobs and restoring neighborhoods  a society bursting with opportunities reaching for its future with confidence sustained by faith fair play and a conviction that good and courageous people will flourish when theyre freethese are the secrets of a strong and prosperous america at peace with itself and the world  a lasting and meaningful peace is our fourth great goal it is our highest aspiration and our record is clear americans resort to force only when we must we have never been aggressors we have always struggled to defend freedom and democracy  we have no territorial ambitions we occupy no countries we build no walls to lock people in americans build the future and our vision of a better life for farmers merchants and working people from the americas to asia begins with a simple premise the future is best decided by ballots not bullets  governments which rest upon the consent of the governed do not wage war on their neighbors only when people are given a personal stake in deciding their own destiny benefiting from their own risks do they create societies that are prosperous progressive and free tonight it is democracies that offer hope by feeding the hungry prolonging life and eliminating drudgery  when it comes to keeping america strong free and at peace there should be no republicans or democrats just patriotic americans we can decide the tough issues not by who is right but by what is right  together we can continue to advance our agenda for peace we can establish a more stable basis for peaceful relations with the soviet union strengthen allied relations across the board achieve real and equitable reductions in the levels of nuclear arms reinforce our peacemaking efforts in the middle east central america and southern africa or assist developing countries particularly our neighbors in the western hemisphere and assist in the development of democratic institutions throughout the world  the wisdom of our bipartisan cooperation was seen in the work of the scowcroft commission which strengthened our ability to deter war and protect peace in that same spirit i urge you to move forward with the henry jackson plan to implement the recommendations of the bipartisan commission on central america  your joint resolution on the multinational peacekeeping force in lebanon is also serving the cause of peace we are making progress in lebanon for nearly 10 years the lebanese have lived from tragedy to tragedy with no hope for their future now the multinational peacekeeping force and our marines are helping them break their cycle of despair there is hope for a free independent and sovereign lebanon we must have the courage to give peace a chance and we must not be driven from our objectives for peace in lebanon by statesponsored terrorism we have seen this ugly specter in beirut kuwait and rangoon it demands international attention i will forward shortly legislative proposals to help combat terrorism and i will be seeking support from our allies for concerted action  our nato alliance is strong 1983 was a banner year for political courage and we have strengthened our partnerships and our friendships in the far east were committed to dialog deterrence and promoting prosperity well work with our trading partners for a new round of negotiations in support of freer world trade greater competition and more open markets  a rebirth of bipartisan cooperation of economic growth and military deterrence and a growing spirit of unity among our people at home and our allies abroad underline a fundamental and farreaching change the united states is safer stronger and more secure in 1984 than before we can now move with confidence to seize the opportunities for peace and we will  tonight i want to speak to the people of the soviet union to tell them its true that our governments have had serious differences but our sons and daughters have never fought each other in war and if we americans have our way they never will  people of the soviet union there is only one sane policy for your country and mine to preserve our civilization in this modern age a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought the only value in our two nations possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will never be used but then would it not be better to do away with them entirely  people of the soviet president dwight eisenhower who fought by your side in world war ii said the essential struggle is not merely man against man or nation against nation it is man against war americans are people of peace if your government wants peace there will be peace we can come together in faith and friendship to build a safer and far better world for our children and our childrens children and the whole world will rejoice that is my message to you  some days when life seems hard and we reach out for values to sustain us or a friend to help us we find a person who reminds us what it means to be americans  sergeant stephen trujillo a medic in the 2d ranger battalion 75th infantry was in the first helicopter to land at the compound held by cuban forces in grenada he saw three other helicopters crash despite the imminent explosion of the burning aircraft he never hesitated he ran across 25 yards of open terrain through enemy fire to rescue wounded soldiers he directed two other medics administered first aid and returned again and again to the crash site to carry his wounded friends to safety  sergeant trujillo you and your fellow service men and women not only saved innocent lives you set a nation free you inspire us as a force for freedom not for despotism and yes for peace not conquest god bless you  and then there are unsung heroes single parents couples church and civic volunteers their hearts carry without complaint the pains of family and community problems they soothe our sorrow heal our wounds calm our fears and share our joy  a person like father ritter is always there his covenant house programs in new york and houston provide shelter and help to thousands of frightened and abused children each year the same is true of dr charles carson paralyzed in a plane crash he still believed nothing is impossible today in minnesota he works 80 hours a week without pay helping pioneer the field of computercontrolled walking he has given hope to 500000 paralyzed americans that some day they may walk again  how can we not believe in the greatness of america how can we not do what is right and needed to preserve this last best hope of man on earth after all our struggles to restore america to revive confidence in our country hope for our future after all our hardwon victories earned through the patience and courage of every citizen we cannot must not and will not turn back we will finish our job how could we do less were americans  carl sandburg said i see america not in the setting sun of a black night of despair i see america in the crimson light of a rising sun fresh from the burning creative hand of god i see great days ahead for men and women of will and vision  ive never felt more strongly that americas best days and democracys best days lie ahead were a powerful force for good with faith and courage we can perform great deeds and take freedoms next step and we will we will carry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who have brought light where there was darkness warmth where there was cold medicine where there was disease food where there was hunger and peace where there was only bloodshed  let us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time that in our time we did everything that could be done we finished the race we kept them free we kept the faith  thank you very much god bless you and god bless america  note the president spoke at 902 pm in the house chamber of the capitol he was introduced by thomas p oneill jr speaker of the house of representatives the address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television  
193, State of the Union Address, Ronald Reagan,1985-02-06,  mr speaker mr president distinguished members of the congress honored guests and fellow citizens  i come before you to report on the state of our union and im pleased to report that after 4 years of united effort the american people have brought forth a nation renewed stronger freer and more secure than before  four years ago we began to change forever i hope our assumptions about government and its place in our lives out of that change has come great and robust growthin our confidence our economy and our role in the world  tonight america is stronger because of the values that we hold dear we believe faith and freedom must be our guiding stars for they show us truth they make us brave give us hope and leave us wiser than we were our progress began not in washington dc but in the hearts of our families communities workplaces and voluntary groups which together are unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under god  four years ago we said we would invigorate our economy by giving people greater freedom and incentives to take risks and letting them keep more of what they earned we did what we promised and a great industrial giant is reborn  tonight we can take pride in 25 straight months of economic growth the strongest in 34 years a 3year inflation average of 39 percent the lowest in 17 years and 73 million new jobs in 2 years with more of our citizens working than ever before  new freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success  for an america of wisdom that honors the family knowing that if as the family goes so goes our civilization  for an america of vision that sees tomorrows dreams in the learning and hard work we do today  for an america of courage whose service men and women even as we meet proudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom  for an america of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for help  we have begun well but its only a beginning were not here to congratulate ourselves on what we have done but to challenge ourselves to finish what has not yet been done  were here to speak for millions in our inner cities who long for real jobs safe neighborhoods and schools that truly teach were here to speak for the american farmer the entrepreneur and every worker in industries fighting to modernize and compete and yes were here to stand and proudly so for all who struggle to break free from totalitarianism for all who know in their hearts that freedom is the one true path to peace and human happiness  proverbs tell us without a vision the people perish when asked what great principle holds our union together abraham lincoln said something in the declaration giving liberty not alone to the people of this country but hope to the world for all future time  we honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to the dreams their vision foresaw my fellow citizens this nation is poised for greatness the time has come to proceed toward a great new challengea second american revolution of hope and opportunity a revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of america enabling us to summon greater strength than weve ever known and a revolution that carries beyond our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world of peace  let us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom there are no constraints on the human mind no walls around the human spirit no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect already pushing down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth  in europe theyre calling it the american miracle day by day were shattering accepted notions of what is possible when i was growing up we failed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace well today many have not yet seen how advances in technology are transforming our lives  in the late 1950s workers at the att semiconductor plant in pennsylvania produced five transistors a day for 750 apiece they now produce over a million for less than a penny apiece  new laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery cut diagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from weeks to minutes reduce hospital costs dramatically and hold out new promise for saving human lives  our automobile industry has overhauled assembly lines increased worker productivity and is competitive once again  we stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more do more be more our economy is not getting older and weaker its getting younger and stronger it doesnt need rest and supervision it needs new challenge greater freedom and that word freedom is the key to the second american revolution that we need to bring about  let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth last year i asked treasury secretarythenregan to develop a plan to simplify the tax code so all taxpayers would be treated more fairly and personal tax rates could come further down  we have cut tax rates by almost 25 percent yet the tax system remains unfair and limits our potential for growth exclusions and exemptions cause similar incomes to be taxed at different levels lowincome families face steep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder the treasury department has produced an excellent reform plan whose principles will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact  one thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise we will not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that families need we will reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many tax preferences we will propose a top rate of no more than 35 percent and possibly lower and we will propose reducing corporate rates while maintaining incentives for capital formation  to encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare we will propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totally exempt from federal income tax to restore fairness to families we will propose increasing significantly the personal exemption  and tonight i am instructing treasury secretary james bakeri have to get used to saying thatto begin working with congressional authors and committees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles we will call upon the american people for support and upon every man and woman in this chamber together we can pass this year a tax bill for fairness simplicity and growth making this economy the engine of our dreams and america the investment capital of the world so let us begin  tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous pentup power of our economy but a second american revolution must carry the promise of opportunity for all it is time to liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country  this government will meet its responsibility to help those in need but policies that increase dependency break up families and destroy selfrespect are not progressive theyre reactionary despite our strides in civil rights blacks hispanics and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power  we have repeatedly sought passage of enterprise zones to help those in the abandoned corners of our land find jobs learn skills and build better lives this legislation is supported by a majority of you  mr speaker i know we agree that there must be no forgotten americans let us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation of entrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year and tip you could make that a birthday present  nor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity wage proposal we can help teenagers who have the highest unemployment rate find summer jobs so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in their futures  well continue to support the job training partnership act which has a nearly twothirds job placement rate credits in education and health care vouchers will help working families shop for services that they need  our administration is already encouraging certain lowincome public housing residents to own and manage their own dwellings its time that all public housing residents have that opportunity of ownership  the federal government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom but states and localities many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery must not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to growth  let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading opportunity that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading freedom  there are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on deficit reductions well the best way to reduce deficits is through economic growth more businesses will be started more investments made more jobs created and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes the best way to reduce government spending is to reduce the need for spending by increasing prosperity each added percentage point per year of real gnp growth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficits of nearly 200 billion over 5 years  to move steadily toward a balanced budget we must also lighten governments claim on our total economy we will not do this by raising taxes we must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth in spending by the federal government in our fiscal year 1986 budget overall government program spending will be frozen at the current level it must not be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985 and three points are key  first the social safety net for the elderly the needy the disabled and unemployed will be left intact growth of our major health care programs medicare and medicaid will be slowed but protections for the elderly and needy will be preserved  second we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equipped trained and ready professional corps national security is governments first responsibility so in past years defense spending took about half the federal budget today it takes less than a third weve already reduced our planned defense expenditures by nearly a hundred billion dollars over the past 4 years and reduced projected spending again this year  you know we only have a militaryindustrial complex until a time of danger and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy spending for defense is investing in things that are pricelesspeace and freedom  third we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies for example deregulation of the airline industry has led to cheaper airfares but on amtrak taxpayers pay about 35 per passenger every time an amtrak train leaves the station its time we ended this huge federal subsidy  our farm program costs have quadrupled in recent years yet i know from visiting farmers many in great financial distress that we need an orderly transition to a marketoriented farm economy we can help farmers best not by expanding federal payments but by making fundamental reforms keeping interest rates heading down and knocking down foreign trade barriers to american farm exports  were moving ahead with grace commission reforms to eliminate waste and improve governments management practices in the long run we must protect the taxpayers from government and i ask again that you pass as 32 states have now called for an amendment mandating the federal government spend no more than it takes in and i ask for the authority used responsibly by 43 governors to veto individual items in appropriation bills senator mattingly has introduced a bill permitting a 2year trial run of the lineitem veto i hope youll pass and send that legislation to my desk  nearly 50 years of government living beyond its means has brought us to a time of reckoning ours is but a moment in history but one moment of courage idealism and bipartisan unity can change american history forever  sound monetary policy is key to longrunning economic strength and stability we will continue to cooperate with the federal reserve board seeking a steady policy that ensures price stability without keeping interest rates artificially high or needlessly holding down growth  reducing unneeded red tape and regulations and deregulating the energy transportation and financial industries have unleashed new competition giving consumers more choices better services and lower prices in just one set of grant programs we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31 we seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies and bring us closer to energy independence consistent with safety standards we will continue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries we will soon end up legislationor send up legislation i should sayto return conrail to the private sector where it belongs and we will support further deregulation of the trucking industry  every dollar the federal government does not take from us every decision it does not make for us will make our economy stronger our lives more abundant our future more free  our second american revolution will push on to new possibilities not only on earth but in the next frontier of space despite budget restraints we will seek record funding for research and development  weve seen the success of the space shuttle now were going to develop a permanently manned space station and new opportunities for free enterprise because in the next decade americans and our friends around the world will be living and working together in space  in the zero gravity of space we could manufacture in 30 days lifesaving medicines it would take 30 years to make on earth we can make crystals of exceptional purity to produce super computers creating jobs technologies and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible  as we do all this well continue to protect our natural resources we will seek reauthorization and expanded funding for the superfund program to continue cleaning up hazardous waste sites which threaten human health and the environment  now theres another great heritage to speak of this evening of all the changes that have swept america the past 4 years none brings greater promise than our rediscovery of the values of faith freedom family work and neighborhood  we see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship renewed optimism and faith in our future love of country rediscovered by our young who are leading the way weve rediscovered that work is good in and of itself that it ennobles us to create and contribute no matter how seemingly humble our jobs weve seen a powerful new current from an old and honorable traditionamerican generosity  from thousands answering peace corps appeals to help boost food production in africa to millions volunteering time corporations adopting schools and communities pulling together to help the neediest among us at home we have refound our values private sector initiatives are crucial to our future  i thank the congress for passing equal access legislation giving religious groups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups enjoy but no citizen need tremble nor the world shudder if a child stands in a classroom and breathes a prayer we ask you again give children back a right they had for a century and a half or more in this country  the question of abortion grips our nation abortion is either the taking of a human life or it isnt and if it isand medical technology is increasingly showing it isit must be stopped it is a terrible irony that while some turn to abortion so many others who cannot become parents cry out for children to adopt we have room for these children we can fill the cradles of those who want a child to love and tonight i ask you in the congress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn  in the area of education were returning to excellence and again the heroes are our people not government were stressing basics of discipline rigorous testing and homework while helping children become computersmart as well for 20 years scholastic aptitude test scores of our high school students went down but now they have gone up 2 of the last 3 years we must go forward in our commitment to the new basics giving parents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for hard work and achievement through merit pay  of all the changes in the past 20 years none has more threatened our sense of national wellbeing than the explosion of violent crime one does not have to be attacked to be a victim the woman who must run to her car after shopping at night is a victim the couple draping their door with locks and chains are victims as is the tired decent cleaning woman who cant ride a subway home without being afraid  we do not seek to violate the rights of defendants but shouldnt we feel more compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime for the first time in 20 years the crime index has fallen 2 years in a row weve convicted over 7400 drug offenders and put them as well as leaders of organized crime behind bars in record numbers  but we must do more i urge the house to follow the senate and enact proposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers acquire in good faith these proposals would also reform the habeas corpus laws and allow in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of americans the use of the death penalty where necessary  there can be no economic revival in ghettos when the most violent among us are allowed to roam free its time we restored domestic tranquility and we mean to do just that  just as were positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy were poised as never before to create a safer freer more peaceful world our alliances are stronger than ever our economy is stronger than ever we have resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world and all of these together are a great force for peace  since 1981 weve been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms agreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear arsenals now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced the soviet union to return to the bargaining table our negotiators must be able to go to that table with the united support of the american people all of us have no greater dream than to see the day when nuclear weapons are banned from this earth forever  each member of the congress has a role to play in modernizing our defenses thus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement your vote this spring on the peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms reductions  for the past 20 years weve believed that no war will be launched as long as each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike well i believe theres a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war it is a strategic defense initiative aimed ultimately at finding a nonnuclear defense against ballistic missiles its the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age but its not very well understood  some say it will bring war to the heavens but its purpose is to deter war in the heavens and on earth now some say the research would be expensive perhaps but it could save millions of lives indeed humanity itself and some say if we build such a system the soviets will build a defense system of their own well they already have strategic defenses that surpass ours a civil defense system where we have almost none and a research program covering roughly the same areas of technology that were now exploring and finally some say the research will take a long time well the answer to that is lets get started  harry truman once said that ultimately our security and the worlds hopes for peace and human progress lie not in measures of defense or in the control of weapons but in the growth and expansion of freedom and selfgovernment  and tonight we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few it is the universal right of all gods children look to where peace and prosperity flourish today it is in homes that freedom built victories against poverty are greatest and peace most secure where people live by laws that ensure free press free speech and freedom to worship vote and create wealth  our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy and to communicate these ideals everywhere we can americas economic success is freedoms success it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred different nations many countries in east asia and the pacific have few resources other than the enterprise of their own people but through low tax rates and free markets theyve soared ahead of centralized economies and now china is opening up its economy to meet its needs  we need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making and implementing trade policy and well be studying potential changes in that process in the next few weeks weve seen the benefits of free trade and lived through the disasters of protectionism tonight i ask all our trading partners developed and developing alike to join us in a new round of trade negotiations to expand trade and competition and strengthen the global economyand to begin it in this next year  there are more than 3 billion human beings living in third world countries with an average per capita income of 650 a year many are victims of dictatorships that impoverished them with taxation and corruption let us ask our allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance that fosters economic development through personal incentives to help these people climb from poverty on their own  we cannot play innocents abroad in a world thats not innocent nor can we be passive when freedom is under siege without resources diplomacy cannot succeed our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend themselves and give them confidence to work for peace and i hope that you in the congress will understand that dollar for dollar security assistance contributes as much to global security as our own defense budget  we must stand by all our democratic allies and we must not break faith with those who are risking their liveson every continent from afghanistan to nicaraguato defy sovietsupported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth  the sandinista dictatorship of nicaragua with full cubansoviet bloc support not only persecutes its people the church and denies a free press but arms and provides bases for communist terrorists attacking neighboring states support for freedom fighters is selfdefense and totally consistent with the oas and un charters it is essential that the congress continue all facets of our assistance to central america i want to work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied to our own security  and tonight ive spoken of great plans and great dreams theyre dreams we can make come true two hundred years of american history should have taught us that nothing is impossible  ten years ago a young girl left vietnam with her family part of the exodus that followed the fall of saigon they came to the united states with no possessions and not knowing a word of english ten years agothe young girl studied hard learned english and finished high school in the top of her class and this may may 22d to be exact is a big date on her calendar just 10 years from the time she left vietnam she will graduate from the united states military academy at west point i thought you might like to meet an american hero named jean nguyen  now theres someone else here tonight born 79 years ago she lives in the inner city where she cares for infants born of mothers who are heroin addicts the children born in withdrawal are sometimes even dropped on her doorstep she helps them with love go to her house some night and maybe youll see her silhouette against the window as she walks the floor talking softly soothing a child in her armsmother hale of harlem and she too is an american hero  jean mother hale your lives tell us that the oldest american saying is new again anything is possible in america if we have the faith the will and the heart history is asking us once again to be a force for good in the world let us begin in unity with justice and love  thank you and god bless you  note the president spoke at 905 pm in the house chamber of the capitol he was introduced by thomas p oneill jr speaker of the house of representatives the address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television  
194, State of the Union Address, Ronald Reagan,1986-02-04,  mr speaker mr president distinguished members of the congress honored guests and fellow citizens  thank you for allowing me to delay my address until this evening we paused together to mourn and honor the valor of our seven challenger heroes and i hope that we are now ready to do what they would want us to do go forward america and reach for the stars we will never forget those brave seven but we shall go forward  mr speaker before i begin my prepared remarks may i point out that tonight marks the 10th and last state of the union message that youve presided over and on behalf of the american people i want to salute you for your service to congress and country heres to you  i have come to review with you the progress of our nation to speak of unfinished work and to set our sights on the future i am pleased to report the state of our union is stronger than a year ago and growing stronger each day tonight we look out on a rising america firm of heart united in spirit powerful in pride and patriotism america is on the move but it wasnt long ago that we looked out on a different land locked factory gates long gasoline lines intolerable prices and interest rates turning the greatest country on earth into a land of broken dreams government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant slamming shut the gates of opportunity threatening to crush the very roots of our freedom what brought america back the american people brought us back with quiet courage and common sense with undying faith that in this nation under god the future will be ours for the future belongs to the free  tonight the american people deserve our thanks for 37 straight months of economic growth for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9 million new jobs in 3 years interest rates cut in half inflation falling over from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today and a mighty river of good worksa record 74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone and despite the pressures of our modern world family and community remain the moral core of our society guardians of our values and hopes for the future family and community are the costars of this great american comeback they are why we say tonight private values must be at the heart of public policies  what is true for families in america is true for america in the family of free nations history is no captive of some inevitable force history is made by men and women of vision and courage tonight freedom is on the march the united states is the economic miracle the model to which the world once again turns we stand for an idea whose time is now only by lifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly prosper and can peace among all nations be secure teddy roosevelt said that a nation that does great work lives forever we have done well but we cannot stop at the foothills when everest beckons its time for america to be all that we can be  we speak tonight of an agenda for the future an agenda for a safer more secure world and we speak about the necessity for actions to steel us for the challenges of growth trade and security in the next decade and the year 2000 and we will do itnot by breaking faith with bedrock principles but by breaking free from failed policies let us begin where storm clouds loom darkestright here in washington dc this week i will send you our detailed proposals tonight let us speak of our responsibility to redefine governments role not to control not to demand or command not to contain us but to help in times of need and above all to create a ladder of opportunity to full employment so that all americans can climb toward economic power and justice on their own  but we cannot win the race to the future shackled to a system that cant even pass a federal budget we cannot win that race held back by horseandbuggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human potential we cannot win that race if were swamped in a sea of red ink now mr speaker you know i know and the american people know the federal budget system is broken it doesnt work before we leave this city lets you and i work together to fix it and then we can finally give the american people a balanced budget  members of congress passage of grammrudmanhollings gives us an historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for decades forcing the federal government to live within its means your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by april 15th the very day americas families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce how often we read of a husband and wife both working struggling from paycheck to paycheck to raise a family meet a mortgage pay their taxes and bills and yet some in congress say taxes must be raised well im sorry theyre asking the wrong people to tighten their belts its time we reduce the federal budget and left the family budget alone we do not face large deficits because american families are undertaxed we face those deficits because the federal government overspends  the detailed budget that we will submit will meet the grammrudmanhollings target for deficit reductions meet our commitment to ensure a strong national defense meet our commitment to protect social security and the truly less fortunate and yes meet our commitment to not raise taxes how should we accomplish this well not by taking from those in need as families take care of their own government must provide shelter and nourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves but we must revise or replace programs enacted in the name of compassion that degrade the moral worth of work encourage family breakups and drive entire communities into a bleak and heartless dependency grammrudmanhollings can mark a dramatic improvement but experience shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure theyll be met we must proceed with grace commission reforms against waste  and tonight i ask you to give me what 43 governors have give me a lineitem veto this year give me the authority to veto waste and ill take the responsibility ill make the cuts ill take the heat this authority would not give me any monopoly power but simply prevent spending measures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own merit and you can sustain or override my veto thats the way the system should work once weve made the hard choices we should lock in our gains with a balanced budget amendment to the constitution  i mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense we must meet it defense is not just another budget expense keeping america strong free and at peace is solely the responsibility of the federal government it is governments prime responsibility we have devoted 5 years trying to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and neglect and weve made important gains yet the threat from soviet forces conventional and strategic from the soviet drive for domination from the increase in espionage and state terror remains great this is reality closing our eyes will not make reality disappear we pledged together to hold real growth in defense spending to the bare minimum my budget honors that pledge and im now asking you the congress to keep its end of the bargain the soviets must know that if america reduces her defenses it will be because of a reduced threat not a reduced resolve  keeping america strong is as vital to the national security as controlling federal spending is to our economic security but as i have said before the most powerful force we can enlist against the federal deficit is an everexpanding american economy unfettered and free the magic of opportunityunreserved unfailing unrestrainedisnt this the calling that unites us i believe our tax rate cuts for the people have done more to spur a spirit of risktaking and help americas economy break free than any program since john kennedys tax cut almost a quarter century ago  now history calls us to press on to complete efforts for an historic tax reform providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay their fair share but no more weve come this far will you join me now and well walk this last mile together you know my views on this we cannot and we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in disguise true reform must be an engine of productivity and growth and that means a top personal rate no higher than 35 percent true reform must be truly fair and that means raising personal exemptions to 2000 true reform means a tax system that at long last is profamily projobs profuture and proamerica  as we knock down the barriers to growth we must redouble our efforts for freer and fairer trade we have already taken actions to counter unfair trading practices and to pry open closed foreign markets we will continue to do so we will also oppose legislation touted as providing protection that in reality pits one american worker against another one industry against another one community against another and that raises prices for us all if the united states can trade with other nations on a level playing field we can outproduce outcompete and outsell anybody anywhere in the world  the constant expansion of our economy and exports requires a sound and stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world we must never again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other exporters farmers in particular have suffered from past unwise government policies they must not be abandoned with problems they did not create and cannot control weve begun coordinating economic and monetary policy among our major trading partners but theres more to do and tonight i am directing treasury secretary jim baker to determine if the nations of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of our currencies  confident in our future and secure in our values americans are striving forward to embrace the future we see it not only in our recovery but in 3 straight years of falling crime rates as families and communities band together to fight pornography drugs and lawlessness and to give back to their children the safe and yes innocent childhood they deserve we see it in the renaissance in education the rising sat scores for 3 yearslast years increase the greatest since 1963 it wasnt government and washington lobbies that turned education around it was the american people who in reaching for excellence knew to reach back to basics we must continue the advance by supporting discipline in our schools vouchers that give parents freedom of choice and we must give back to our children their lost right to acknowledge god in their classrooms  we are a nation of idealists yet today there is a wound in our national conscience america will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our creator is denied to the unborn for the rest of my time i shall do what i can to see that this wound is one day healed  as we work to make the american dream real for all we must also look to the condition of americas families struggling parents today worry how they will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave them in the welfare culture the breakdown of the family the most basic support system has reached crisis proportionsin female and child poverty child abandonment horrible crimes and deteriorating schools after hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs the plight of the poor grows more painful but the waste in dollars and cents pales before the most tragic loss the sinful waste of human spirit and potential we can ignore this terrible truth no longer as franklin roosevelt warned 51 years ago standing before this chamber he said welfare is a narcotic a subtle destroyer of the human spirit and we must now escape the spiders web of dependency  tonight i am charging the white house domestic council to present me by december 1 1986 an evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediate action to meet the financial educational social and safety concerns of poor families im talking about real and lasting emancipation because the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare further after seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial security of the family i am directing the secretary of health and human services dr otis bowen to report to me by year end with recommendations on how the private sector and government can work together to address the problems of affordable insurance for those whose life savings would otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illness strikes  and tonight i want to speak directly to americas younger generation because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands with all the temptations young people face it sometimes seems the allure of the permissive society requires superhuman feats of selfcontrol but the call of the future is too strong the challenge too great to get lost in the blind alleyways of dissolution drugs and despair never has there been a more exciting time to be alive a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement as they said in the film back to the future where were going we dont need roads  well today physicists peering into the infinitely small realms of subatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith astronomers build a space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and possibly back to the moment of creation so yes this nation remains fully committed to americas space program were going forward with our shuttle flights were going forward to build our space station and we are going forward with research on a new orient express that could by the end of the next decade take off from dulles airport accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound attaining low earth orbit or flying to tokyo within 2 hours and the same technology transforming our lives can solve the greatest problem of the 20th century a security shield can one day render nuclear weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear terror america met one historic challenge and went to the moon now america must meet another to make our strategic defense real for all the citizens of planet earth  let us speak of our deepest longing for the future to leave our children a land that is free and just and a world at peace it is my hope that our fireside summit in geneva and mr gorbachevs upcoming visit to america can lead to a more stable relationship surely no people on earth hate war or love peace more than we americans but we cannot stroll into the future with childlike faith our differences with a system that openly proclaims and practices an alleged right to command peoples lives and to export its ideology by force are deep and abiding logic and history compel us to accept that our relationship be guided by realismrockhard cleareyed steady and sure our negotiators in geneva have proposed a radical cut in offensive forces by each side with no cheating they have made clear that soviet compliance with the letter and spirit of agreements is essential if the soviet government wants an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms there will be such an agreement  but arms control is no substitute for peace we know that peace follows in freedoms path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is denied so we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but by bolstering prosperity liberty and democracy however and wherever we can we advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on behalf of lower tax rates freer markets sound currencies around the world we strengthen the family of freedom every time we work with allies and come to the aid of friends under siege and we can enlarge the family of free nations if we will defend the unalienable rights of all gods children to follow their dreams  to those imprisoned in regimes held captive to those beaten for daring to fight for freedom and democracyfor their right to worship to speak to live and to prosper in the family of free nationswe say to you tonight you are not alone freedom fighters america will support with moral and material assistance your right not just to fight and die for freedom but to fight and win freedomto win freedom in afghanistan in angola in cambodia and in nicaragua this is a great moral challenge for the entire free world  surely no issue is more important for peace in our own hemisphere for the security of our frontiers for the protection of our vital interests than to achieve democracy in nicaragua and to protect nicaraguas democratic neighbors this year i will be asking congress for the means to do what must be done for that great and good cause as former senator henry mscoop jackson the inspiration for our bipartisan commission on central america once said in matters of national security the best politics is no politics  what we accomplish this year in each challenge we face will set our course for the balance of the decade indeed for the remainder of the century after all weve done so far let no one say that this nation cannot reach the destiny of our dreams america believes america is ready america can win the race to the futureand we shall the american dream is a song of hope that rings through night winter air vivid tender music that warms our hearts when the least among us aspire to the greatest things to venture a daring enterprise to unearth new beauty in music literature and art to discover a new universe inside a tiny silicon chip or a single human cell  we see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of richard cavoli all his life hes been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine and richard we know that the experiment that you began in high school was launched and lost last week yet your dream lives and as long as its real work of noble note will yet be done work that could reduce the harmful effects of x rays on patients and enable astronomers to view the golden gateways of the farthest stars  we see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12yearold tyrone ford a child prodigy of gospel music he has surmounted personal adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer he also directs the choirs of three churches and has performed at the kennedy center with god as your composer tyrone your music will be the music of angels  we see the dream being saved by the courage of the 13yearold shelby butler honor student and member of her schools safety patrol seeing another girl freeze in terror before an outofcontrol school bus she risked her life and pulled her to safety with bravery like yours shelby america need never fear for our future  and we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a 13 year old trevor ferrell two years ago age 11 watching men and women bedding down in abandoned doorwayson television he was watchingtrevor left his suburban philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the helpless and homeless and now 250 people help him fulfill his nightly vigil trevor yours is the living spirit of brotherly love  would you four stand up for a moment thank you thank you you are heroes of our hearts we look at you and know its true in this land of dreams fulfilled where greater dreams may be imagined nothing is impossible no victory is beyond our reach no glory will ever be too great  so now its up to us all of us to prepare america for that day when our work will pale before the greatness of americas champions in the 21st century the worlds hopes rest with americas future americas hopes rest with us so let us go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith in unity and in love  god bless you and god bless america  note the president spoke at 804 pm in the house chamber of the capitol he was introduced by thomas p oneill jr speaker of the house of representatives the address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television  
195, State of the Union Address, Ronald Reagan,1987-01-27,  mr speaker mr president distinguished members of congress honored guests and fellow citizens  may i congratulate all of you who are members of this historic 100th congress of the united states of america in this 200th anniversary year of our constitution you and i stand on the shoulders of giantsmen whose words and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom however we must always remember that our constitution is to be celebrated not for being old but for being youngyoung with the same energy spirit and promise that filled each eventful day in philadelphias statehouse we will be guided tonight by their acts and we will be guided forever by their words  now forgive me but i cant resist sharing a story from those historic days philadelphia was bursting with civic pride in the spring of 1787 and its newspapers began embellishing the arrival of the convention delegates with elaborate social classifications governors of states were called excellency justices and chancellors had reserved for them honorable with a capital h for congressmen it was honorable with a small h and all others were referred to as the following respectable characters well for this 100th congress i invoke special executive powers to declare that each of you must never be titled less than honorable with a capital h incidentally im delighted you are celebrating the 100th birthday of the congress its always a pleasure to congratulate someone with more birthdays than ive had  now theres a new face at this place of honor tonight and please join me in warm congratulations to the speaker of the house jim wright mr speaker you might recall a similar situation in your very first session of congress 32 years ago then as now the speakership had changed hands and another great son of texas sam rayburnmr samsat in your chair i cannot find better words than those used by president eisenhower that evening he said we shall have much to do together i am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and good will tonight i renew that pledge to you mr speaker and to senate majority leader robert byrd who brings 34 years of distinguished service to the congress may i say though there are changes in the congress americas interests remain the same and i am confident that along with republican leaders bob michel and bob dole this congress can make history  six years ago i was here to ask the congress to join me in americas new beginning well the results are something of which we can all be proud our inflation rate is now the lowest in a quarter of a century the prime interest rate has fallen from the 21 12 percent the month before we took office to 7 12 percent today and those rates have triggered the most housing starts in 8 years the unemployment ratestill too highis the lowest in nearly 7 years and our people have created nearly 13 million new jobs over 61 percent of everyone over the age of 16 male and female is employedthe highest percentage on record lets roll up our sleeves and go to work and put americas economic engine at full throttle we can also be heartened by our progress across the world most important america is at peace tonight and freedom is on the march and weve done much these past years to restore our defenses our alliances and our leadership in the world our sons and daughters in the services once again wear their uniforms with pride  but though weve made much progress i have one major regret i took a risk with regard to our action in iran it did not work and for that i assume full responsibility the goals were worthy i do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance or to try to save lives and certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity but we did not achieve what we wished and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so we will get to the bottom of this and i will take whatever action is called for but in debating the past we must not deny ourselves the successes of the future let it never be said of this generation of americans that we became so obsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world much is at stake here and the nation and the world are watching to see if we go forward together in the national interest or if we let partisanship weaken us and let there be no mistake about american policy we will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in the middle east are threatened nor will we yield to terrorist blackmail  and now ladies and gentlemen of the congress why dont we get to work i am pleased to report that because of our efforts to rebuild the strength of america the world is a safer place earlier this month i submitted a budget to defend america and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect in the last decade well i ask you to vote out a defense and foreign affairs budget that says yes to protecting our country while the world is safer it is not safe  since 1970 the soviets have invested 500 billion more on their military forces than we have even today though nearly 1 in 3 soviet families is without running hot water and the average family spends 2 hours a day shopping for the basic necessities of life their government still found the resources to transfer 75 billion in weapons to client states in the past 5 yearsclients like syria vietnam cuba libya angola ethiopia afghanistan and nicaragua with 120000 soviet combat and military personnel and 15000 military advisers in asia africa and latin america can anyone still doubt their singleminded determination to expand their power despite this the congress cut my request for critical us security assistance to free nations by 21 percent this year and cut defense requests by 85 billion in the last 3 years  these assistance programs serve our national interests as well as mutual interests and when the programs are devastated american interests are harmed my friends its my duty as president to say to you again tonight that there is no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve today the brave people of afghanistan are showing that resolve the soviet union says it wants a peaceful settlement in afghanistan yet it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered we are ready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawal of all soviet troops and genuine selfdetermination for the afghan people  in central america too the cause of freedom is being tested and our resolve is being tested there as well here especially the world is watching to see how this nation responds today over 90 percent of the people of latin america live in democracy democracy is on the march in central and south america communist nicaragua is the odd man outsuppressing the church the press and democratic dissent and promoting subversion in the region we support diplomatic efforts but these efforts can never succeed if the sandinistas win their war against the nicaraguan people  our commitment to a western hemisphere safe from aggression did not occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we took office it began with the monroe doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan american policy franklin roosevelt said we are determined to do everything possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere president truman was very blunt international communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroy the independence of the americas we cannot let that happen here and john f kennedy made clear that communist domination in this hemisphere can never be negotiated some in this congress may choose to depart from this historic commitment but i will not  this year we celebrate the second century of our constitution the sandinistas just signed theirs 2 weeks ago and then suspended it we wont know how my words tonight will be reported there for one simple reason there is no free press in nicaragua nicaraguan freedom fighters have never asked us to wage their battle but i will fight any effort to shut off their lifeblood and consign them to death defeat or a life without freedom there must be no soviet beachhead in central america  you know we americans have always preferred dialog to conflict and so we always remain open to more constructive relations with the soviet union but more responsible soviet conduct around the world is a key element of the ussoviet agenda progress is also required on the other items of our agenda as wellreal respect for human rights and more open contacts between our societies and of course arms reduction  in iceland last october we had one moment of opportunity that the soviets dashed because they sought to cripple our strategic defense initiative sdi i wouldnt let them do it then i wont let them do it now or in the future this is the most positive and promising defense program we have undertaken its the path for both sides to a safer futurea system that defends human life instead of threatening it sdi will go forward the united states has made serious fair and farreaching proposals to the soviet union and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction but i will need and american negotiators in geneva will need congress support enacting the soviet negotiating position into american law would not be the way to win a good agreement so i must tell you in this congress i will veto any effort that undercuts our national security and our negotiating leverage  now today we also find ourselves engaged in expanding peaceful commerce across the world we will work to expand our opportunities in international markets through the uruguay round of trade negotiations and to complete an historic free trade arrangement between the worlds two largest trading partners canada and the united states our basic trade policy remains the same we remain opposed as ever to protectionism because americas growth and future depend on trade but we would insist on trade that is fair and free we are always willing to be trade partners but never trade patsies  now from foreign borders let us return to our own because america in the world is only as strong as america at home this 100th congress has high responsibilities i begin with a gentle reminder that many of these are simply the incomplete obligations of the past the american people deserve to be impatient because we do not yet have the public house in order weve had great success in restoring our economic integrity and weve rescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the depression but theres more to do for starters the federal deficit is outrageous for years ive asked that we stop pushing onto our children the excesses of our government and what the congress finally needs to do is pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces government to live within its means states cities and the families of america balance their budgets why cant we  next the budget process is a sorry spectacle the missing of deadlines and the nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing hundreds of billions of dollars of spending into one bill must be stopped we ask the congress once again give us the same tool that 43 governors havea lineitem veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork those items that would never survive on their own i will send the congress broad recommendations on the budget but first id like to see yours lets go to work and get this done together  but now lets talk about this years budget even though i have submitted it within the grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction target i have seen suggestions that we might postpone that timetable well i think the american people are tired of hearing the same old excuses together we made a commitment to balance the budget now lets keep it as for those suggestions that the answer is higher taxes the american people have repeatedly rejected that shopworn advice they know that we dont have deficits because people are taxed too little we have deficits because big government spends too much  now next month ill place two additional reforms before the congress weve created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our sense of priorities our national welfare system consists of some 59 major programs and over 6000 pages of federal laws and regulations on which more than 132 billion was spent in 1985 i will propose a new national welfare strategy a program of welfare reform through statesponsored communitybased demonstration projects this is the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap now we will never abandon those who through no fault of their own must have our help but let us work to see how many can be freed from the dependency of welfare and made selfsupporting which the great majority of welfare recipients want more than anything else next let us remove a financial specter facing our older americans the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death i will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness  now lets turn to the future its widely said that america is losing her competitive edge well that wont happen if we act now how well prepared are we to enter the 21st century in my lifetime america set the standard for the world it is now time to determine that we should enter the next century having achieved a level of excellence unsurpassed in history we will achieve this first by guaranteeing that government does everything possible to promote americas ability to compete second we must act as individuals in a quest for excellence that will not be measured by new proposals or billions in new funding rather it involves an expenditure of american spirit and just plain american grit the congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness including new science and technology centers and strong new funding for basic research the bill will include legal and regulatory reforms and weapons to fight unfair trade practices competitiveness also means giving our farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing world market  preparing for the future must begin as always with our children we need to set for them new and more rigorous goals we must demand more of ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by the year 2000 our children should master the basic concepts of math and science and lets insist that students not leave high school until they have studied and understood the basic documents of our national heritage theres one more thing we cant let up on lets redouble our personal efforts to provide for every child a safe and drugfree learning environment if our crusade against drugs succeeds with our children we will defeat that scourge all over the country  finally lets stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being our nation could not have been conceived without divine help why is it that we can build a nation with our prayers but we cant use a schoolroom for voluntary prayer the 100th congress of the united states should be remembered as the one that ended the expulsion of god from americas classrooms  the quest for excellence into the 21st century begins in the schoolroom but must go next to the workplace more than 20 million new jobs will be created before the new century unfolds and by then our economy should be able to provide a job for everyone who wants to work we must also enable our workers to adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the workplace and i will propose substantial new federal commitments keyed to retraining and job mobility  over the next few weeks ill be sending the congress a complete series of these special messageson budget reform welfare reform competitiveness including education trade worker training and assistance agriculture and other subjects the congress can give us these tools but to make these tools work it really comes down to just being our best and that is the core of american greatness the responsibility of freedom presses us towards higher knowledge and i believe moral and spiritual greatness through lower taxes and smaller government government has its ways of freeing peoples spirits but only we each of us can let the spirit soar against our own individual standards excellence is what makes freedom ring and isnt that what we do best  were entering our third century now but its wrong to judge our nation by its years the calendar cant measure america because we were meant to be an endless experiment in freedomwith no limit to our reaches no boundaries to what we can do no end point to our hopes the united states constitution is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we travel through history it grew out of the most fundamental inspiration of our existence that we are here to serve him by living freethat living free releases in us the noblest of impulses and the best of our abilities that we would use these gifts for good and generous purposes and would secure them not just for ourselves and for our children but for all mankind  over the yearsi wont count if you dontnothing has been so heartwarming to me as speaking to americas young and the little ones especially so freshfaced and so eager to know well from time to time ive been with themthey will ask about our constitution and i hope you members of congress will not deem this a breach of protocol if youll permit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might be listening or watching this evening ive read the constitutions of a number of countries including the soviet unions now some people are surprised to hear that they have a constitution and it even supposedly grants a number of freedoms to its people many countries have written into their constitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly well if this is true why is the constitution of the united states so exceptional  well the difference is so small that it almost escapes you but its so great it tells you the whole story in just three words we the people in those other constitutions the government tells the people of those countries what theyre allowed to do in our constitution we the people tell the government what it can do and it can do only those things listed in that document and no others virtually every other revolution in history has just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers our revolution is the first to say the people are the masters and government is their servant and you young people out there dont ever forget that someday you could be in this room but wherever you are america is depending on you to reach your highest and be your bestbecause here in america we the people are in charge  just three words we the peoplethose are the kids on christmas day looking out from a frozen sentry post on the 38th parallel in korea or aboard an aircraft carrier in the mediterranean a million miles from home but doing their duty  we the peoplethose are the warmhearted whose numbers we cant begin to count wholl begin the day with a little prayer for hostages they will never know and mia families they will never meet why because thats the way we are this unique breed we call americans  we the peopletheyre farmers on tough times but who never stop feeding a hungry world theyre the volunteers at the hospital choking back their tears for the hundredth time caring for a baby struggling for life because of a mother who used drugs and youll forgive me a special memoryits a million mothers like nelle reagan who never knew a stranger or turned a hungry person away from her kitchen door  we the peoplethey refute last weeks television commentary downgrading our optimism and our idealism they are the entrepreneurs the builders the pioneers and a lot of regular folksthe true heroes of our land who make up the most uncommon nation of doers in history you know theyre americans because their spirit is as big as the universe and their hearts are bigger than their spirits  we the peoplestarting the third century of a dream and standing up to some cynic whos trying to tell us were not going to get any better are we at the end well i cant tell it any better than the real thinga story recorded by james madison from the final moments of the constitutional convention september 17th 1787 as the last few members signed the document benjamin franklinthe oldest delegate at 81 years and in frail healthlooked over toward the chair where george washington daily presided at the back of the chair was painted the picture of a sun on the horizon and turning to those sitting next to him franklin observed that artists found it difficult in their painting to distinguish between a rising and a setting sun  well i know if we were there we could see those delegates sitting around franklinleaning in to listen more closely to him and then dr franklin began to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of their efforts and this is what he said i have often looked at that picture behind the president without being able to tell whether it was a rising or setting sun but now at length i have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun well you can bet its rising because my fellow citizens america isnt finished her best days have just begun  thank you god bless you and god bless america  note the president spoke at 903 pm in the house chamber of the capitol he was introduced by jim wright speaker of the house of representatives the address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television  
196, State of the Union Address, Ronald Reagan,1988-01-25,  mr speaker mr president and distinguished members of the house and senate when we first met here 7 years agomany of us for the first timeit was with the hope of beginning something new for america we meet here tonight in this historic chamber to continue that work if anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my administration i say lets leave that to history were not finished yet so my message to you tonight is put on your work shoes were still on the job  history records the power of the ideas that brought us here those 7 years agoideas like the individuals right to reach as far and as high as his or her talents will permit the free market as an engine of economic progress and as an ancient chinese philosopher laotzu said govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish do not overdo it well these ideas were part of a larger notion a vision if you will of america herselfan america not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an america too of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods an america whose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper community of values the value of work of family of religion and of the love of freedom that god places in each of us and whose defense he has entrusted in a special way to this nation  all of this was made possible by an idea i spoke of when mr gorbachev was herethe belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind began with three simple words we the people the revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights and not the other way around and theres one lesson that has come home powerfully to me which i would offer to you now just as those who created this republic pledged to each other their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor so too americas leaders today must pledge to each other that we will keep foremost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for our party but what is best for america  in the spirit of jefferson let us affirm that in this chamber tonight there are no republicans no democratsjust americans yes we will have our differences but let us always remember what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us those who sent us here to serve themthe millions of americans watching and listening tonightexpect this of us lets prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year weve done this before and as we have worked together to bring down spending tax rates and inflation employment has climbed to record heights america has created more jobs and better higher paying jobs family income has risen for 4 straight years and americas poor climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in more than 10 years  our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history but an economic and social revolution of hope based on work incentives growth and opportunity a revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77percent increase in charitable giving a revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and restored the american dream  in international relations too theres only one description for what together we have achieved a complete turnabout a revolution seven years ago america was weak and freedom everywhere was under siege today america is strong and democracy is everywhere on the move from central america to east asia ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold weve replaced blame america with look up to america weve rebuilt our defenses and of all our accomplishments none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are again proud to wear our countrys uniform  and in a few moments im going to talk about three developmentsarms reduction the strategic defense initiative and the global democratic revolutionthat when taken together offer a chance none of us would have dared imagine 7 years ago a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era i speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror  tonight then were strong prosperous at peace and we are free this is the state of our union and if we will work together this year i believe we can give a future president and a future congress the chance to make that prosperity that peace that freedom not just the state of our union but the state of our world  toward this end we have four basic objectives tonight first steps we can take this year to keep our economy strong and growing to give our children a future of low inflation and full employment second lets check our progress in attacking social problems where important gains have been made but which still need critical attention i mean schools that work economic independence for the poor restoring respect for family life and family values our third objective tonight is global continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions weve seen around the world fourth and finally our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decade and a half as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world freedom we must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the next president inherits what you and i have a moral obligation to give that president a national security that is unassailable and a national defense that takes full advantage of new technology and is fully funded  this is a full agenda its meant to be you see my thinking on the next year is quite simple lets make this the best of 8 and that means its all outright to the finish line i dont buy the idea that this is the last year of anything because were not talking here tonight about registering temporary gains but ways of making permanent our successes and thats why our focus is the values the principles and ideas that made america great lets be clear on this point were for limited government because we understand as the founding fathers did that it is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual so that every american of every race and region shares fully in the flowering of american prosperity and freedom  one other thing we americans likethe futurelike the sound of it the idea of it the hope of it where others fear trade and economic growth we see opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamedof opportunities for millions in our own land and beyond where others seek to throw up barriers we seek to bring them down where others take counsel of their fears we follow our hopes yes we americans like the future and like making the most of it lets do that now  and lets begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by controlling and eventually eliminating the problem of federal deficits we have had a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years for the first time in 14 years the federal government spent less in real terms last year than the year before we took 73 billion off last years deficit compared to the year before the deficit itself has moved from 63 percent of the gross national product to only 34 percent and perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits you know a few of us can remember when not too many years ago those who created the deficits said they would make us prosperous and not to worry about the debt because we owe it to ourselves well at last there is agreement that we cant spend ourselves rich  our recent budget agreement designed to reduce federal deficits by 76 billion over the next 2 years builds on this consensus but this agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past more broken promises and more unchecked spending as i indicated in my first state of the union what ails us can be simply put the federal government is too big and it spends too much money i can assure you the bipartisan leadership of congress of my help in fighting off any attempt to bust our budget agreement and this includes the swift and certain use of the veto power  now its also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle to controlling federal deficits the simple but frustrating problem of making expenses match revenuessomething american families do and the federal government canthas caused crisis after crisis in this city mr speaker mr president i will say to you tonight what i have said before and will continue to say the budget process has broken down it needs a drastic overhaul with each ensuing year the spectacle before the american people is the same as it was this christmas budget deadlines delayed or missed completely monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending into one bill and a federal government on the brink of default  i know im echoing what you here in the congress have said because you suffered so directly but lets recall that in 7 years of 91 appropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date only 10 made it on time last year of the 13 appropriations bills due by october 1st none of them made it instead we had four continuing resolutions lasting 41 days then 36 days and 2 days and 3 days respectively  and then along came these behemoths this is the conference report1053 pages report weighing 14 pounds then thisa reconciliation bill 6 months late that was 1186 pages long weighing 15 pounds and the longterm continuing resolutionthis one was 2 months late and its 1057 pages long weighing 14 pounds that was a total of 43 pounds of paper and ink you had 3 hoursyes 3 hoursto consider each and it took 300 people at my office of management and budget just to read the bill so the government wouldnt shut down congress shouldnt send another one of these no and if you do i will not sign it  lets change all this instead of a presidential budget that gets discarded and a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced why not a simple partnership a joint agreement that sets out the spending priorities within the available revenues and lets remember our deadline is october 1st not christmas lets get the peoples work done in time to avoid a footrace with santa claus and yes this yearto coin a phrasea new beginning 13 individual bills on time and fully reviewed by congress  im also certain you join me in saying lets help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the president a tool that though i will not get to use it is one i know future presidents of either party must have give the president the same authority that 43 governors use in their states the right to reach into massive appropriation bills pare away the waste and enforce budget discipline lets approve the lineitem veto  and lets take a partial step in this direction most of you in this chamber didnt know what was in this catchall bill and report over the past few weeks weve all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there for example theres millions for items such as cranberry research blueberry research the study of crawfish and the commercialization of wildflowers and thats not to mention the five or so million 5 million thatso that people from developing nations could come here to watch congress at work i wont even touch that so tonight i offer you this challenge in 30 days i will send back to you those items as rescissions which if i had the authority to line them out i would do so  now review this multibilliondollar package that will not undercut our bipartisan budget agreement as a matter of fact if adopted it will improve our deficit reduction goals and what an example we can set that were serious about getting our financial accounts in order by acting and approving this plan you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that is out of control  there is another vital reform yes grammrudmanhollings has been profoundly helpful but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent let us do now what so many states do to hold down spending and what 32 state legislatures have asked us to do let us heed the wishes of an overwhelming plurality of americans and pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces the federal government to live within its means reform of the budget processincluding the lineitem veto and balanced budget amendmentwill together with real restraint on government spending prevent the federal budget from ever again ravaging the family budget  lets ensure that the federal government never again legislates against the family and the home last september 1 signed an executive order on the family requiring that every department and agency review its activities in light of seven standards designed to promote and not harm the family but let us make certain that the family is always at the center of the public policy process not just in this administration but in all future administrations its time for congress to consider at the beginning a statement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit of american society the family  and speaking of the family lets turn to a matter on the mind of every american parent tonight education we all know the sorry story of the sixties and seventiessoaring spending plummeting test scoresand that hopeful trend of the eighties when we replaced an obsession with dollars with a commitment to quality and test scores started back up theres a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a hundred times in a childs education money can never take the place of basics like discipline hard work and yes homework  as a nation we do of course spend heavily on educationmore than we spend on defense yet across our country governors like new jerseys tom kean are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend is as important as how much we spend opening up the teaching profession to all qualified candidates merit payso that good teachers get as as well as applesand stronger curriculum as secretary bennett has proposed for high schoolsthese imaginative reforms are making common sense the most popular new kid in americas schools how can we help well we can talk about and push for these reforms but the most important thing we can do is to reaffirm that control of our schools belongs to the states local communities and most of all to the parents and teachers  my friends some years ago the federal government declared war on poverty and poverty won today the federal government has 59 major welfare programs and spends more than 100 billion a year on them what has all this money done well too often it has only made poverty harder to escape federal welfare programs have created a massive social problem with the best of intentions government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty the family dependency has become the one enduring heirloom passed from one generation to the next of too many fragmented families  it is timethis may be the most radical thing ive said in 7 years in this officeits time for washington to show a little humility there are a thousand sparks of genius in 50 states and a thousand communities around the nation it is time to nurture them and see which ones can catch fire and become guiding lights states have begun to show us the way theyve demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more effective child support enforcement practices and innovative programs requiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work let us give the states more flexibility and encourage more reforms lets start making our welfare system the first rung on americas ladder of opportunity a boost up from dependency not a graveyard but a birthplace of hope  and now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and the quality of family life the first is an untold american success story recently we released our annual survey of what graduating high school seniors have to say about drugs cocaine use is declining and marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began we can be proud that our students are just saying no to drugs but let us remember what this menace requires commitment from every part of america and every single american a commitment to a drugfree america the war against drugs is a war of individual battles a crusade with many heroes including americas young people and also someone very special to me she has helped so many of our young people to say no to drugs nancy much credit belongs to you and i want to express to you your husbands pride and your countrys thanks surprised you didnt i  well now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to confront tonight i call americaa good nation a moral peopleto charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand to those who say this violates a womans right to control of her own body can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child is a living human being entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all federal funding for abortion and with a human life amendment making of course an exception where the unborn child threatens the life of the mother our judeochristian tradition recognizes the right of taking a life in selfdefense but with that one exception let us look to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt i pledge to you tonight i will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full sharing in family life to millions of americans so that children who need homes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them  and let me add here so many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us that spiritual values alone are essential to our nations health and vigor the congress opens its proceedings each day as does the supreme court with an acknowledgment of the supreme being yet we are denied the right to set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray i believe congress should pass our school prayer amendment  now to make sure there is a full nine member supreme court to interpret the law to protect the rights of all americans i urge the senate to move quickly and decisively in confirming judge anthony kennedy to the highest court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fill vacancies in the federal judiciary  here then are our domestic priorities yet if the congress and the administration work together even greater opportunities lie ahead to expand a growing world economy to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear arms and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of democratic institutions  our policies consistently received the strongest support of the late congressman dan daniel of virginia im sure all of you join me in expressing heartfelt condolences on his passing  one of the greatest contributions the united states can make to the world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth a creative competitive america is the answer to a changing world not trade wars that would close doors create greater barriers and destroy millions of jobs we should always remember protectionism is destructionism americas jobs americas growth americas future depend on tradetrade that is free open and fair  this year we have it within our power to take a major step toward a growing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches to all the free nations of this earth im speaking of the historic free trade agreement negotiated between our country and canada and i can also tell you that were determined to expand this concept south as well as north next month i will be traveling to mexico where trade matters will be of foremost concern and over the next several months our congress and the canadian parliament can make the start of such a north american accord a reality our goal must be a day when the free flow of trade from the tip of tierra del fuego to the arctic circle unites the people of the western hemisphere in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange when all borders become what the uscanadian border so long has been a meeting place rather than a dividing line  this movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom is indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom and against totalitarian rule this global democratic revolution has removed the specter so frightening a decade ago of democracy doomed to permanent minority status in the world in south and central america only a third of the people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976 today over 90 percent of latin americans live in nations committed to democratic principles and the resurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous people on almost every continent who have struggled to take control of their own destiny  in nicaragua the struggle has extra meaning because that nation is so near our own borders the recent revelations of a former highlevel sandinista major roger miranda show us that even as they talk peace the communist sandinista government of nicaragua has established plans for a large 600000man army yet even as these plans are made the sandinista regime knows the tide is turning and the cause of nicaraguan freedom is riding at its crest because of the freedom fighters who are resisting communist rule the sandinistas have been forced to extend some democratic rights negotiate with church authorities and release a few political prisoners  the focus is on the sandinistas their promises and their actions there is a consensus among the four central american democratic presidents that the sandinistas have not complied with the plan to bring peace and democracy to all of central america the sandinistas again have promised reforms their challenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy on wednesday my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted which reflects our mutual desire for peace freedom and democracy in nicaragua i ask congress to pass this request let us be for the people of nicaragua what lafayette pulaski and von steuben were for our forefathers and the cause of american independence  so too in afghanistan the freedom fighters are the key to peace we support the mujahidin there can be no settlement unless all soviet troops are removed and the afghan people are allowed genuine selfdetermination i have made my views on this matter known to mr gorbachev but not just nicaragua or afghanistanyes everywhere we see a swelling freedom tide across the world freedom fighters rising up in cambodia and angola fighting and dying for the same democratic liberties we hold sacred their cause is our cause freedom  yet even as we work to expand world freedom we must build a safer peace and reduce the danger of nuclear war but lets have no illusions three years of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment have increased the risk of our most basic security interests jeopardizing earlier hardwon goals we must face squarely the implications of this negative trend and make adequate stable defense spending a top goal both this year and in the future  this same concern applies to economic and security assistance programs as well but the resolve of america and its nato allies has opened the way for unprecedented achievement in arms reduction our recently signed inf treaty is historic because it reduces nuclear arms and establishes the most stringent verification regime in arms control history including several forms of shortnotice onsite inspection i submitted the treaty today and i urge the senate to give its advice and consent to ratification of this landmark agreement thank you very much  in addition to the inf treaty were within reach of an even more significant start agreement that will reduce us and soviet longrange missileor strategic arsenals by half but let me be clear our approach is not to seek agreement for agreements sake but to settle only for agreements that truly enhance our national security and that of our allies we will never put our security at riskor that of our alliesjust to reach an agreement with the soviets no agreement is better than a bad agreement  as i mentioned earlier our efforts are to give future generations what we never hada future free of nuclear terror reduction of strategic offensive arms is one step sdi another our funding request for our strategic defense initiative is less than 2 percent of the total defense budget sdi funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent sdi has the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction it reduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all mankind strategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a safer more stable basis for deterrence we must also remember that sdi is our insurance policy against a nuclear accident a chernobyl of the sky or an accidental launch or some madman who might come along  weve seen such changes in the world in 7 years as totalitarianism struggles to avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance and the aspiration for human freedom it is the free nations that are resilient and resurgent as the global democratic revolution has put totalitarianism on the defensive we have left behind the days of retreat america is again a vigorous leader of the free world a nation that acts decisively and firmly in the furtherance of her principles and vital interests no legacy would make me more proud than leaving in place a bipartisan consensus for the cause of world freedom a consensus that prevents a paralysis of american power from ever occurring again  but my thoughts tonight go beyond this and i hope youll let me end this evening with a personal reflection you know the world could never be quite the same again after jacob shallus a trustworthy and dependable clerk of the pennsylvania general assembly took his pen and engrossed those words about representative government in the preamble of our constitution and in a quiet but final way the course of human events was forever altered when on a ridge overlooking the emmitsburg pike in an obscure pennsylvania town called gettysburg lincoln spoke of our duty to government of and by the people and never letting it perish from the earth  at the start of this decade i suggested that we live in equally momentous times that it is up to us now to decide whether our form of government would endure and whether history still had a place of greatness for a quiet pleasant greening land called america not everything has been made perfect in 7 years nor will it be made perfect in seven times 70 years but before us this year and beyond are great prospects for the cause of peace and world freedom  it means too that the young americans i spoke of 7 years ago as well as those who might be coming along the virginia or maryland shores this night and seeing for the first time the lights of this capital citythe lights that cast their glow on our great halls of government and the monuments to the memory of our great menit means those young americans will find a city of hope in a land that is free  we can be proud that for them and for us as those lights along the potomac are still seen this night signaling as they have for nearly two centuries and as we pray god they always will that another generation of americans has protected and passed on lovingly this place called america this shining city on a hill this government of by and for the people  thank you and god bless you  note the president spoke at 907 pm in the house chamber of the capitol he was introduced by jim wright speaker of the house of representatives the address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television  
197, State of the Union Address, George H.W. Bush,1990-01-31,  tonight i come not to speak about the state of the government not to detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year nor describe every line in the budget im here to speak to you and to the american people about the state of the union about our world the changes weve seen the challenges we face and what that means for america  there are singular moments in history dates that divide all that goes before from all that comes after and many of us in this chamber have lived much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in 1945 and the events of that year decreed the shape of nations the pace of progress freedom or oppression for millions of people around the world  nineteen fortyfive provided the common frame of reference the compass points of the postwar era weve relied upon to understand ourselves and that was our world until now the events of the year just ended the revolution of 89 have been a chain reaction changes so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the worlds affairs  think back think back just twelve short months ago to the world we knew as 1989 began  one year one year ago the people of panama lived in fear under the thumb of a dictator today democracy is restored panama is free  operation just cause has achieved its objective and the number of military personel in panama is now very close to what it was before the operation began and tonight i am announcing that before the end of february the additional numbers of american troops the brave men and women of our armed forces who made this mission a success will be back home  a year ago in poland lech walesa declared he was ready to open a dialogue with the communist rulers of that country and today with the future of a free poland in their own hands members of solidarity lead the polish government  and a year ago freedoms playwright vaclav havel languished as a prisoner in prague and today its vaclav havel president of czechoslovakia  and one year ago erich honecker of east germany claimed history as his guide he predicted the berlin wall would last another hundred years and today less than one year later its the wall thats history  remarkable events remarkable events events that fulfill the longheld hopes of the american people events that validate the longstanding goals of american policy a policy based upon a single shining principle the cause of freedom  america not just the nation but an idea alive in the minds of the people everywhere as this new world takes shape america stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom today tomorrow and into the next century  our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on these shores and the millions still struggling to be free this nation this idea called america was and always will be a new world our new world  at a workers rally in a place called branik on the outskirts of prague the idea called america is alive a worker dressed in grimy overalls rises to speak at the factory gates and he begins his speech to his fellow citizens with these words words of a distant revolution we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights and that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness its no secret here at home freedoms door opened long ago the cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place democracy competition opportunity private investment stewardship and of course leadership  and our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours a system second to none and make it better  a better america where theres a job for whoever wants one  where women working outside the home can be confident their children are in safe and loving care and where government works to expand child alternatives for parents  where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy  where made in the usa is recognized around the world as the symbol of quality and progress  and where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live to work and to contribute to society and where for the first time the american mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens  where everyone has a roof over his head and where the homeless get the help they need to live in dignity  where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers and every one of them makes the grade  where every street every city every school and every child is drugfree  and finally and finally where no american is forgotten our hearts go out to our hostages our hostages who are ceaselessly in our minds and in our efforts thats part of the future we want to see the future we can make for ourselves but dreams alone wont get us there we need to extend our horizon to commit to the long view and our mission for the future starts today  in the tough competitive markets around the world america faces the great challenges and great opportunities and we know that we can succeed in the global economic arena of the 90s but to meet that challenge we must make some fundamental changes some crucial investments in ourselves  yes we are going to invest in america this administration is determined to encourage the creation of capital capital of all kinds physical capital everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and production lines all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods and quality services intellectual intellectual capital the source of ideas that spark tomorrows products and of course human capital the talented work force that well need to compete in the global market  and let me tell you if we ignore human capital if we lose the spirit of american ingenuity the sprit that is the hallmark of the american worker that would be bad the american worker is the most productive worker in the world  we need to save more we need to expand the pool of capital for new investments that mean more jobs and more growth and thats the idea behind the new initiative i call the family savings plan which i will send to congress tomorrow  we need to cut the tax on capital gains encourage encourage risktakers especially those in small businesses to take those steps that translate into economic reward jobs and a better life for all of us  well do what it takes to invest in americas future the budget commitment is there the money is there its there for research and development r and d a record high its there for our housing initiative hope hope to help everyone from firsttime homebuyers to the homeless the moneys there to keep our kids drugfree 70 percent more than when i took office in 1989 its there for space exploration and its there for education another record high  and one more and one more thing last fall at the education summit the governors and i agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are ready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom and ive made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds an extra half billion dollars for something near and dear to all of us head start  education is the one investment that means more for our future because it means the most for our children real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of spending more its a matter of asking more expecting more of our schools our teachers of our kids of our parents and of ourselves and thats why tonight and thats why tonight i am announcing americas education goals goals developed with enormous cooperation from the nations governors and if i might id like to say im very pleased that governor gardner and governor clinton governor branstad governor campbell all of whom were very key in these discussion these deliberations are with us here tonight  by the by the year 2000 every child must start school ready to learn the united states must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than 90 percent and we are going to make sure our schools diplomas mean something in critical subjects at the fourth eighth and 12th grades we must assess our students performance  by the by the year 2000 us students must be the first in the world in math and science achievement every american adult must be a skilled literate worker and citizen every school must offer the kind of disciplined environment that makes it possible for our kids to learn and every school in america must be drugfree  ambitious aims of course easy to do far from it but the futures at stake the nation will not accept anything less than excellence in education  these investments will help keep america competitive and i know this about the american people we welcome competition well match our ingenuity our energy our experience and technology our spirit and enterprise against anyone but let the competition be free but let it also be fair america is ready  since we really mean it and since were serious about being ready to meet our challenge were getting our own house in order we have made real progress seven years ago the federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross national product 6 percent in the new budget i sent up two days ago the deficit is down to 1 percent of gnp  that budget brings federal spending under control it meets the grammrudman target it brings the deficit down further and balances the budget by 1993 with no new taxes  and let me tell you theres still more than enough federal spending for most of us 12 trillion is still a lot of money  and once the budget is balanced we can operate the way every family must when it has bills to pay we wont leave it to our children and grandchildren once its balanced we will start paying off the national debt  and theres something more and theres something more we owe the generations of the future stewardship the safekeeping of americas precious environmental inheritance  as just one sign of how serious we are we will elevate the environmental protection agency to cabinet rank not not more bureaucracy not more red tape but the certainty that here at home and especially in our dealings with other nations environmental issues have the status they deserve  this years budget provides over 2 billion in new spending to protect our environment with over 1 billion for global change research and a new initiative i call america the beautiful to expand our national parks and wildlife preserves and improve recreational facilities on public lands  and something else something that will help keep this country clean from our forest land to the inner cities and keep america beautiful for generations to come the money to plant a billion trees a year  and tonight and tonight let me say again to all the members of the congress the american people did not send us here to bicker there is work to do and they sent us here to get it done and once again in the spirit of cooperation i offer my hand to all of you and lets work together to do the will of the peopleclean air child care the educational excellence act crime and drugs its time to act the farm bill transportation policy product liability reform enterprise zones its time to act together  and theres one thing i hope we can agree on its about our commitments and im talking about social security  to every american out there on social security to every every american supporting that system today and to everyone counting on it when they retire we made a promise to you and we are going to keep it  we we rescued the system in 1983 and its sound again bipartisan arrangement our budget fully funds todays benefits and it assures that future benefits will be funded as well and the last thing we need to do is mess around with social security  theres one more problem we need to address we must give careful consideration to the recommendations of the health care studies under way now and thats why tonight i am asking dr sullivan lou sullivan secretary of health and human services to lead a domestic policy council review of recommendations on the quality accessibility and cost of our nations health care system i am committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control  the state of the government does indeed depend on many of us in this very chamber but the state of the union depends on all americans we must maintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of individuals and ive been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this country every one of us must confront and condemn racism antisemitism bigotry and hate not next week not tomorrow but right now every single one of us  the state of the union depends on whether we help our neighbor claim the problems of our community as our own weve got to step forward when theres trouble lend a hand be what i call a point of light to a stranger in need weve got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids help them with their homework pass along the values we had as children and thats how we sustain the state of the union  every effort is important it all adds up its doing the things that give democracy meaning it all adds up to who we are and who we will be  and let me say that so long as we remember the american idea so long as we live up to the american ideal the state of the union will remain sound and strong  and to those who worry that weve lost our way well i want you to listen to parts of a letter written by james markwell pvt 1st class james markwell a 20yearold army medic to the first battalion 75th rangers its dated dec 18 the day before our armed forces went into action in panama its a letter servicemen writeand hope will never ever be sent and sadly private markwells mother did receive this letter she passed it on to me out there in cincinnati  and here is some of what he wrote ive never been afraid of death but i know he is waiting at the cornerive been trained to kill and to save and so has everyone else i am frightened of what lays beyond the fog and yet do not mourn for me revel in the life that i have died to give you but most of all dont forget that the army was my choice something that i wanted to do remember i joined the army to serve my country and inure that you are free to do what you want and to live your lives freely  let me add that private markwell was among the first to see battle in panama and among the first to fall but he knew what he believed in he carried the idea we call america in his heart  i began tonight speaking about the changes weve seen this past year there is a new world of challenges and opportunities before us and there is a need for leadership that only america can provide  nearly 40 years ago in his last address to the congress president harry truman predicted such a time would come he said as our world grows stronger more united more attractive to men on both sides of the iron curtain then inevitably there will come a time of change within the communist world today that change is taking place  for more than 40 years america and its allies held communism in check and insured that democracy would continue to exist and today with communism crumbling our aim must be to insure democracys advance to take the lead in forging peace and freedoms best hope a great and growing commonwealth of free nations  and to the congress and to all americans i say it is time to acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad a common vision of the peaceful world we want to see  here in our own hemisphere it is time for all the people of the americas north and south to live in freedom  in the far east and africa its time for the full flowering of free governments and free markets that have served the engine of progress  it is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of eastern europe so that continent for too long a continent divided can see a future whole and free  its time to build on our new relationship with the soviet union to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic opportunity  we are in a period of great transition great hope and yet great uncertainty we recognize that the soviet military threat in europe is diminishing but we see little change in soviet strategic modernization and therefore we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and the strategic defense initiative  but the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in europe a coherent defense program that insures the us will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in europe and ive consulted with leaders of nato in fact i spoke by phone with president gorbachev just today  and i agree with our european allies that an american military presence in europe is essential and that it should not be solely tied to the soviet military presence in eastern europe  but our troop levels can still be lower and so tonight i am announcing a major new step for a further reduction in us and soviet manpower in central and eastern europe to 195000 on each side  this number this number this level reflects the advice of our senior military advisers its designed to protect american and european interests and sustain natos defense strategy a swift conclusion to our arms control talksconventional chemical and strategicmust now be our goal and that time has come  still we must recognize an unfortunate fact in many regions of the world tonight the reality is conflict not peace enduring animosities and opposing interests remain and thus the cause of peace must be served by an america strong enough and sure enough to defend our interests and our ideals its this american idea that for the past four decades helped inspire the revolution of 89  and here at home and in the world there is history in the making and history to be made six months ago early in this season of change i stood at the gates of the gdansk shipyard in poland at the monument to the fallen workers of solidarity its a monument of simple majesty three tall crosses rise up from the stones and atop each cross an anchor an ancient symbol of hope  the anchor in our world today is freedom holding us steady in times of change a symbol of hope to all the world and freedom is at the very heart of the idea that is america giving life to the idea depends on every one of us our anchor has always been faith and family  in the last few days of this past monumentous year our family was blessed once more celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th grandchild when i held the little guy for the first time the troubles at home and abroad seemed manageable and totally in perspective  and now i know i know youre probably thinking well thats just a grandfather talking  well maybe youre right but ive met a lot of children this past year across this country as all of you have everywhere from the far east to eastern europe all kids are unique yet all kids are alike the budding young environmentalist i met this month who joined me in exploring the florida everglades the little leaguers i played catch with in poland ready to go from warsaw to the world series and even the kids who are ill or aloneand god bless those boarder babies born addicted to drugs and aidscoping with problems no child should have to face but you know when it comes to hope and the future every kid is the same full of dreams ready to take on the world all special because they are the very future of freedom and to them belongs this new world ive been speaking about  and so tonight im going to ask something of every one of you now let me start with my generation with the grandparents out there you are our living link with the past tell your grandchildren the story of struggles waged at home and abroad of sacrifices freely made for freedoms sake and tell them your own story as well because every american has a story to tell  and parents your children look to you for direction and guidance tell them of faith and family tell them we are one nation under god teach them that of all the many gifts they can receive liberty is their most precious legacy and of all the gifts they can give the greatest the greatest is helping others  and to the children and young people out there tonight with you rests our hope all that america will mean in the years and decades ahead fix your vision on a new century your century on dreams we cannot see on the destiny that is yours and yours alone  and finally let all americans all of us here in this chamber the symbolic center of democracy affirm our allegiance to this idea we call america and let us remember that the state of the union depends upon each and every one of us  god bless all of you and may god bless this great nation the united states of america  
198, State of the Union Address, George H.W. Bush,1991-01-29,  mr president mr speaker members of the united states congress  i come to this house of the people to speak to you and all americans certain we stand at a defining hour  halfway around the world we are engaged in a great struggle in the skies and on the seas and sands we know why were there we are americanspart of something larger than ourselves  for two centuries weve done the hard work of freedom and tonight we lead the world in facing down a threat to decency and humanity  what is at stake is more than one small country it is a big ideaa new world order where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind peace and security freedom and the rule of law such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our childrens future  the community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel lawless aggression saddam husseins unprovoked invasionhis ruthless systematic rape of a peaceful neighborviolated everything the community of nations holds dear the world has said this aggression would not stand and it will not stand  together we have resisted the trap of appeasement cynicism and isolation that gives temptation to tyrants the world has answered saddams invasion with 12 united nations resolutions starting with a demand for iraqs immediate and unconditional withdrawal and backed up by forces from 28 countries of six continents with few exceptions the world now stands as one  the end of the cold war has been a victory for all humanity a year and a half ago in germany i said our goal was a europe whole and free tonight germany is united europe has become whole and free and americas leadership was instrumental in making it possible  the principle that has guided us is simple our objective is to help the baltic peoples achieve their aspirations not to punish the soviet union in our recent discussions with the soviet leadership we have been given representations which if fulfilled would result in the withdrawal of some soviet forces a reopening of dialogue with the republics and a move away from violence  we will watch carefully as the situation develops and we will maintain our contact with the soviet leadership to encourage continued commitment to democratization and reform  if it is possible i want to continue to build a lasting basis for ussoviet cooperation for a more peaceful future for all mankind  the triumph of democratic ideas in eastern europe and latin america and the continuing struggle for freedom elsewhere around the world all confirm the wisdom of our nations founders  tonight we work to achieve another victory a victory over tyranny and savage aggression  we in this union enter the last decade of the 20th century thankful for all our blessings steadfast in our purpose aware of our difficulties and responsive to our duties at home and around the world  for two centuries america has served the world as an inspiring example of freedom and democracy for generations america has led the struggle to preserve and extend the blessings of liberty and today in a rapidly changing world american leadership is indispensable americans know that leadership brings burdens and requires sacrifice  but we also know why the hopes of humanity turn to us we are americans we have a unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom and when we do freedom works  the conviction and courage we see in the persian gulf today is simply the american character in action the indomitable spirit that is contributing to this victory for world peace and justice is the same spirit that gives us the power and the potential to meet our challenges at home  we are resolute and resourceful if we can selflessly confront evil for the sake of good in a land so far away then surely we can make this land all it should be  if anyone tells you americas best days are behind her theyre looking the wrong way  tonight i come before this house and the american people with an appeal for renewal this is not merely a call for new government initiatives it is a call for new initiative in government in our communities and from every americanto prepare for the next american century  america has always led by example so who among us will set this example which of our citizens will lead us in this next american century everyone who steps forward today to get one addict off drugs to convince one troubled teenager not to give up on life to comfort one aids patient to help one hungry child  we have within our reach the promise of renewed america we can find meaning and reward by serving some purpose higher than ourselvesa shining purpose the illumination of a thousand points of light it is expressed by all who know the irresistible force of a childs hand of a friend who stands by you and stays therea volunteers generous gesture an idea that is simply right  the problems before us may be different but the key to solving them remains the same it is the individualthe individual who steps forward and the state of our union is the union of each of us one to the other the sum of our friendships marriages families and communities  we all have something to give so if you know how to read find someone who cant if youve got a hammer find a nail if youre not hungry not lonely not in troubleseek out someone who is  join the community of conscience do the hard work of freedom that will define the state of our union  since the birth of our nation we the people has been the source of our strength what government can do alone is limited but the potential of the american people knows no limits  we are a nation of rocksolid realism and cleareyed idealism we are americans we are the nation that believes in the future we are the nation that can shape the future  and weve begun to do just that by strengthening the power and choice of individuals and families  together these last two years weve put dollars for child care directly in the hands of patients instead of bureaucracies unshackled the potential of americans with disabilities applied the creativity of the marketplace in the service of the environment for clean air and made homeownership possible for more americans  the strength of a democracy is not in bureaucracy it is in the people and their communities in everything we do let us unleash the potential of our most precious resourceour citizens we must return to families communities counties cities states and institutions of every kind the power to chart their own destiny and the freedom and opportunity provided by strong economic growth thats what america is all about  i know tonight in some regions of our country people are in genuine economic distress i hear them  earlier this month kathy blackwell of massachusetts wrote me about what can happen when the economy slows down saying my heart is aching and i think that you should knowyour people out here are hurting badly  i understand and im not unrealistic about the future but there are reasons to be optimistic about our economy  first we dont have to fight doubledigit inflation second most industries wont have to make big cuts in production because they dont have big inventories piled up and third our exports are running solid and strong in fact american businesses are exporting at a record rate  so lets put these times in perspective together since 1981 weve created almost 20 million jobs cut inflation in half and cut interest rates in half  yes the largest peacetime economic expansion in history has been temporarily interrupted but our economy is still over twice as large as our closest competitor  we will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon we will get on our way to a new record of expansion and achieve the competitive strength that will carry us into the next american century  we should focus our efforts today on encouraging economic growth investing in the future and giving power and opportunity to the individual  we must begin with control of federal spending thats why im submitting a budget that holds the growth in spending to less than the rate of inflation and thats why amid all the sound and fury of last years budget debate we put into law new enforceable spending caps so that future spending debates will mean a battle of ideas not a bidding war  though controversial the budget agreement finally put the federal government on a payasyougo basis and cut the growth of debt by nearly 500 billion and that frees funds for saving and jobcreating investment  now lets do more my budget again includes taxfree family savings accounts penaltyfree withdrawals from i r as for firsttime homebuyers and to increase jobs and growth a reduced tax for longterm capital gains  i know their are differences among us about the impact and the effects of a capital gains incentive so tonight i am asking the congressional leaders and the federal reserve to cooperate with us in a study led by chairman alan greenspan to sort out our technical differences so that we can avoid a return to unproductive partisan bickering  but just as our efforts will bring economic growth now and in the future they must also be matched by longterm investments for the next american century  that requires a forwardlooking plan of action and thats exactly what we will be sending to the congress we have prepared a detailed series of proposals that include a budget that promotes investment in americas futurein children education infrastructure space and high technology legislation to achieve excellence in education building on the partnership forged with the 50 governors at the education summit enabling parents to choose their childrens schools and helping to make america no 1 in math and science a blueprint for a new national highway system a critical investment in our transportation infrastructure a research and development agenda that includes record levels of federal investment and a permanent tax credit to strengthen private r and d and create jobs a comprehensive national energy strategy that calls for energy conservation and efficiency increased development and greater use of alternative fuels a banking reform plan to bring americas financial system into the 21st century so that our banks remain safe and secure and can continue to make jobcreating loans for our factories businesses and homebuyers i do think there has been too much pessimism sound banks should be making more sound loans now and interest rates should be lower now in addition to these proposals we must recognize that our economic strength depends upon being competitive in world markets we must continue to expand americas exports a successful uruguay round of world trade negotiations will create more real jobs and more real growth for all nations you and i know that if the playing field is level americas workers and farmers can outwork and outproduce anyone anytime anywhere  and with the mexican free trade agreement and our enterprise for the americas initiative we can help our partners strengthen their economies and move toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere  the budget also includes a plan of action right here at home to put more power and opportunity in the hands of the individual that means new incentives to create jobs in our inner cities by encouraging investment through enterprise zones it also means tenant control and ownership of public housing freedom and the power to choose should not be the privilege of wealth they are the birthright of every american  civil rights are also crucial to protecting equal opportunity every one of us has a responsibility to speak out against racism bigotry and hate we will continue our vigorous enforcement of existing statutes and i will once again press the congress to strengthen the laws against employment discrimination without resorting to the use of unfair preferences  were determined to protect another fundamental civil right freedom from crime and the fear that stalks our cities the attorney general will soon convene a crime summit of the nations lawenforcement officials and to help us support them we need a tough crime control legislation and we need it now  as we fight crime we will fully implement our nation strategy for combatting drug abuse recent data show we are making progress but much remains to be done we will not rest until the day of the dealer is over forever  good health care is every americans right and every americans responsibility so we are proposing an aggression program of new prevention initiativesfor infants for children for adults and for the elderly to promote a healthier america and to help keep costs from spiraling  its time to give people more choice in government by reviving the ideal of the citizen politician who comes not to stay but to serve one of the reasons there is so much support for term limitations is that the american people are increasingly concerned about bigmoney influence in politics we must look beyond the next election to the next generation the time has come to put the national interest ahead of the special interestand totally eliminate political action committees  that would truly put more competition in elections and more power in the hands of individuals and where power cannot be put directly into the hands of the individual it should be moved closer to the peopleaway from washington  the federal government too often treats government programs as if they are of washington by washington and for washington once established federal programs seem to become immortal  its time for a more dynamic program life cycle some programs should increase some should decrease some should be terminated and some should be consolidated and turned over to the states  my budget includes a list of programs for potential turnover totaling more than 20 billion working with congress and the governors i propose we select at least 15 billion in such programs and turn them over to the states in a single consolidated grant fully funded for flexible management by the states  the value of this turnover approach is straightforward it allows the federal government to reduce overhead it allows states to manage more flexibly and more efficiently it moves power and decisionmaking closer to the people and it reenforces a theme of this administration appreciation and encouragement of the innovative power of states as laboratories  this nation was founded by leaders who understood that power belongs in the hands of the people they planned for the future and so must wehere and around the world  as americans we know there are times when we must step forward and accept our responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictators toward the bright promise of a better day  almost 50 years ago we began a long struggle against aggressive totalitarianism now we face another defining hour for america and the world  there is no one more devoted more committed to the hard work of freedom than every soldier and sailor every marine airman and coastguardsman every man and every woman now serving in the persian gulf  each of them has volunteered to provide for this nations defense and now they bravely struggle to earn for america and for the world and for future generations a just and lasting peace  our commitment to them must be equal of their commitment to our country they are truly americas finest  the war in the gulf is not a war we wanted we worked hard to avoid war for more than five months we along with the arab league the european community and the united nations tried every diplomatic avenue un secretary general perez de cuellar presidents gorbachev mitterand ozal mubarak and bendjedid kings fahd and hassan prime ministers major and andreottijust to name a fewall worked for a solution but time and again saddam hussein flatly rejected the path of diplomacy and peace  the world well knows how this conflict began and when it began on august 2nd when saddam invaded and sacked a small defenseless neighbor and i am certain of how it will end so that peace can prevail we will prevail  tonight im pleased to report that we are on course iraqs capacity to sustain war is being destroyed our investment our training our planning all are paying off time will not be saddams salvation  our purpose in the persian gulf remains constant to drive iraq out from kuwait to restore kuwaits legitimate government and to insure the stability and security of this critical region  let me make clear what i mean by the regions stability and security we do not seek the destruction of iraq its culture or its people rather we seek an iraq that uses its great resources not to destroy not to serve the ambitions of a tyrant but to build a better life for itself and its neighbors we seek a persian gulf where conflict is no longer the rule where the strong are neither tempted nor able to intimidate the weak  most americans know instinctively why we are in the gulf they know we had to stop saddam now not later they know this brutal dictator will do anything will use any weapon will commit any outrage no matter how many innocents must suffer  they know we must make sure that control of the worlds oil resources does not fall into his hands only to finance further aggression they know that we need to build a new enduring peacebased not on arms races and confrontation but on shared principles and the rule of law  and we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace in the region does not end with the successful conclusion of this war  democracy brings the undeniable value of thoughtful dissent and we have heard some dissenting voices here at home some reckless most responsible but the fact the all the voices have the right to speak out is one of the reasons weve been united in principle and purpose for 200 years  our progress in this great struggle is the result of years of vigilance and a steadfast commitment to a strong defense now with remarkable technological advances like the patriot missile we can defend the ballistic missile attacks aimed at innocent civilians  looking forward i have directed that the sdi program be refocused on providing protection from limited ballistic missile strikes whatever their source let us pursue an sdi program that can deal with any future threat to the united states to our forces overseas and to our friends and allies  the quality of american technology thanks to the american worker has enabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions and help minimize the loss of life we have given our men and women the very best and they deserve it  we all have a special place in our hearts for the families of men and women serving in the gulf they are represented here tonight by mrs norman schwarzkopf and to all those serving with him and to the families let me say our forces in the gulf will not stay there one day longer than is necessary to complete their mission  the courage and success of the raf pilotsof the kuwaiti saudi french canadians italians the pilots of qatar and bahrainall are proof that for the first time since world war ii the international community is united the leadership of the united nations once only a hopedfor ideal is now confirming its founders vision  i am heartened that we are not being asked to bear alone the financial burden of this struggle last year our friends and allies provided the bulk of the economic costs of desert shield and having now received commitments of over 40 billion for the first three months of 1991 i am confident they will do no less as we move through desert storm  but the world has to wonder what the dictator of iraq is thinking if he thinks that by targeting innocent civilians in israel and saudi arabia that he will gain an advantagehe is dead wrong if he thinks that he will advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental terrorismhe is dead wrong and if he thinks that by abusing coalition pows he will benefithe is dead wrong  we will succeed in the gulf and when we do the world community will have sent an enduring warning to any dictator or despot present or future who contemplates outlaw aggression  the world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill the longheld promise of a new world orderwhere brutality will go unrewarded and aggression will meet collective resistance  yes the united states bears a major share of leadership in this effort among the nations of the world only the united states of america has had both the moral standing and the means to back it up we are the only nation on this earth that could assemble the forces of peace  this is the burden of leadershipand the strength that has made america the beacon of freedom in a searching world  this nation has never found glory in war our people have never wanted to abandon the blessings of home and work for distant lands and deadly conflict if we fight in anger it is only because we have to fight at all and all of us yearn for a world where we will never have to fight again  each of us will measure within ourselves the value of this great struggle any cost in lives is beyond our power to measure but the cost of closing our eyes to aggression is beyond mankinds power to imagine  this we do know our cause is just our cause is moral our cause is right  let future generations understand the burden and the blessings of freedom let them say we stood where duty required us to stand  let them know that together we affirmed america and the world as a community of conscience  the winds of change are with us now the forces of freedom are united we move toward the next century more confident than ever that we have the will at home and abroad to do what must be donethe hard work of freedom  may god bless the united states of america  
199, State of the Union Address, George H.W. Bush,1992-01-28,  mr speaker mr president distinguished members of congress honored guests and fellow citizens  i mean to speak tonight of big things of big changes and the promises they hold and of some big problems and how together we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age  we gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in the history of man on earth for in the past 12 months the world has known changes of almost biblical proportions and even now months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system i am not sure we have absorbed the full impact the full import of what happened  but communism died this year even as president with the most fascinating possible vantage point there were times when i was so busy helping to manage progress and lead change that i didnt always show the joy that was in my heart but the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life in our lives is this by the grace of god america won the cold war and theres another to be singled out though it may seem inelegant i mean a mass of people called the american taxpayer no ever thinks to thank the people who pay countrys bill or an alliances bill but for a half century now the american people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial communism had never existed but it did but it doesnt anymore and here is a fact i wouldnt mind the world acknowledging the american taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden and deserves a hunk of the glory  and so now for the first time in 35 years our strategic bombers stand down no longer are they on roundtheclock alert tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow and they wont have as my children did airraid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war my grandchildren dont have to do that and wont have the bad dreams children once had in decades past there are still threats but the long drawnout dread is over  a year ago tonight i spoke to you at a moment of high peril american forces had just unleashed operation desert storm and after 40 days in the desert skies and 4 days on the ground the men and women of americas armed forces and our allies accomplished the goals that i declared and that you endorsed we liberated kuwait  soon after the arab world and israel sat down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace an historic first and soon after that at christmas the last american hostages came home our policies were vindicated  much good can come from the prudent use of power and much good can come from this a world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power the united states of america and this they regard with no dread for the world trusts us with power and the world is right they trust us to be fair and restrained they trust us to be on the side of decency they trust us to do whats right  i use those words advisedly a few days after the war began i received a telegram from joanne speicher the wife of the first pilot killed in the gulf lieutenant commander scott speicher even in her grief she wanted me to know that some day when her children were old enough she would tell them that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to do she said it all it was the right thing to do  and we did it together there were honest differences here in this chamber but when the war began you put your partisanship aside and supported our troops this is still a time for pride but this is no time to boast for problems face us and we must stand together once again and solve themand not let our country down  two years ago i began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era but now this year with imperial communism gone that process can be accelerated tonight i can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force these are actions we are taking on our own because they are the right thing to do  after completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement we will shut down production of the b2 bomber we will cancel the icbm program we will cease production of new warheads for our seabased missiles we will stop all production of the peacekeeper missile and we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles  this weekend i will meet at camp david with boris yeltsin of the russian federation i have informed president yeltsin that if the commonwealth the former soviet union will eliminate all landbased multiplewarhead ballistic missiles i will do the following we will eliminate all peacekeeper missiles we will reduce the number of warheads on minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our seabased missiles by about onethird and we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic to primarily conventional use  president yeltsins early response has been very positive and i expect our talks at camp david to be fruitful i want you to know that for half a century american presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words but even in the midst of celebration we must keep caution as a friend for the world is still a dangerous place only the dead have seen the end of conflict and though yesterdays challenges are behind us tomorrows are being born  the secretary of defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the joint chiefs of staff and i make them with confidence but do not misunderstand me the reductions i have approved will save us an additional 50 billion over the next five years by 1997 we will have cut defense by 30 percent since i took office these cuts are deep and you must know my resolve this deep and no deeper to do less would be insensible to progress but to do more would be ignorant of history we must not go back to the days of the hollow army we cannot repeat the mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if the world was permanently safe  i remind you this evening that i have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack we must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms there are those who say that now we can turn away from the world that we have no special role no special place but we are the united states of america the leader of the west that has become the leader of the world  as long as i am president we will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere not out of arrogance and not out of altruism but for the safety and security of our children this is a fact strength in the pursuit of peace is no vice isolationism in the pursuit of security is no virtue  now to our troubles at home they are not all economic but the primary problem is our economy there are some good signs inflation that thief is down and interest rates are down but unemployment is too high some industries are in trouble and growth is not what it should be let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart i know were in hard times but i know something else this will not stand  my friends in this chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we brought to desert storm and we can defeat hard times together i believe you will help one reason is that youre patriots and you want the best for your country and i believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done because its the right thing to do  the power of america rests in a stirring but simple idea that people will do great things if only you set them free well were going to have to set the economy free for if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything its that if we can change the world we can change america  we must encourage investment we must make it easier for people to invest money and make new products new industries and new jobs we must clear away obstacles to new growth high taxes high regulation red tape and yes wasteful government spending none of this will happen with a snap of the fingers but it will happen and the test of a plan isnt whether its called new or dazzling the american people arent impressed by gimmicks theyre smarter on this score than all of us in this room the only test of a plan is it is sound and will it work we must have a shortterm plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy and then we need a longterm plan to keep the combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy  there are certain things that a president can do without congress and i am going to do them i have this evening asked major cabinet departments and federal agencies to institute a 90day moratorium on any new federal regulations that could hinder growth in those 90 days major departments and agencies will carry out a toptobottom review of all regulations old and new to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth  further for the untold number of hardworking responsible american workers and businessmen and women whove been forced to go without needed bank loans the banking credit crunch must end i wont neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good but regulatory overkill must be stopped and i have instructed our government regulators to stop it  i have directed cabinet departments and federal agencies to speed up progrowth expenditures as quickly as possible this should put an extra 10 billion into the economy in the next six months and our new transportation bill provides more than 150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and wellbeing that means jobs building roads jobs building bridges and jobs building railways and i have this evening directed the secretary of the treasury to change the federal tax withholding tables with this change millions of americans from whom the government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have the government withhold less from their paychecks something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one this initiative could return about 25 billion back into the economy over the next 12 months money people can use to help pay for clothing college or a new car and finally working with the federal reserve we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down  now these are the things that i can do and now members of congress let me tell you what you can do for your country you must you must pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs everyone knows investment speeds recovery and i am proposing this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new 15 investment tax allowance this will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work real estate has led our economy out of almost all the tough times weve ever had once building starts carpenters and plumbers work people buy homes and take out mortgages  my plan would modify the passiveloss rule for active realestate developers and it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real estate for those americans who dream of buying a first home but who cant quite afford it my plan would allow firsttime home buyers to withdraw savings from iras without penalty and provide a 5000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home  and finally my immediate plan calls on congress to give crucial help to people who own a home to every one who has a business a farm or a single investment  this time at this hour i cannot take no for an answer you must cut the capital gains tax on the people of this country never has an issue been so demagogued by its opponents but the demagogues are wrong they are wrong and they know it sixty percent of people who benefit from lower capital gains have incomes under 50000 a cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country and so im asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 154 and ill tell you ill tell you those of you who say oh no someone whos comfortable may benefit from this you kind of remind me of the old definition of the puritan who couldnt sleep at night worrying that somehow someone somewhere was out having a good time  the opponents of this measure and those whove authored various socalled soaktherich bills that are floating around this chamber should be reminded of something when they aim at the big guy they usually hit the little guy and maybe its time that stopped  this then is my shortterm plan your part members of congress requires enactment of these commonsense proposals that will have a strong effect on the economy without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax rates and while my plan is being passed and kicking in weve got to care for those in trouble today i have provided for up to 44 billion in my budget to extend federal unemployment benefits and i ask for congressional action right away and i thank the committeewell at last and lets be frank lets be frank let me level with you  i know and you know that my plan is unveiled in a political season i know and you know that everything i propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms but i ask you to know what is in my heart and my aim is to increase our nations good and im doing what i think is right im proposing what i know will help i pride myself that im a prudent man and i believe that patience is a virtue but i understand politics is for some a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement but let me tell you let me tell you far more important than my political futureand far more important than yoursis the wellbeing of our country and members of this chamber members of this chamber are practical people and i know you wont resent some practical advice when people put their partys fortunes whatever the party whatever the side of this aisle before the public good they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves and they will certainly deserve it  and i submit my plan tomorrow and i am asking you to pass it by march 20 from the day after thatif it must bethe battle is joined and you know when principle is at stake i relish a good fair fight  i said my plan has two parts and it does and its the second part that is the heart of the matter for its not enough to get an immediate burst we need longterm improvement in our economic position we all know that the key to our economic future is to insure that america continues as the economic leader of the world we have that in our power here then is my longterm plan to guarantee our future  first trade we will work to break down the walls that stop world trade we will work to open markets everywhere and in our major trade negotiations i will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage americas farmers and workers and well get more good american jobs within our own hemisphere through the north american free trade agreement and through the enterprise for the americas initiative but changes are here and more are coming the work place of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever people who are computer literate highly educated  and we must be the worlds leader in education and we must revolutionize americas schools my america 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal my plan will give parents more choice give teachers more flexibility and help communities create new american schools thirty states across the nation have established america 2000 programs hundreds of cities and towns have joined now congress must join this great movement pass my proposals for new american schools  that was my second longterm proposal and heres my third we must make commonsense investments that will help us compete longterm in the marketplace we must encourage research and development my plan is to make the r and d tax credit permanent and to provide record levels of support over 76 billion this year alone for people who explore the promise of emerging technologies  and fourth we must do something about crime and drugs and it is time for a major renewed investment in fighting violent street crime its saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society and in our future together surely a tired woman on her way to work at six in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely and surely its true that everyone who changes his or her way of life because of crimefrom those afraid to go our at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay forsurely those people have been denied a basic civil right it is time to restore it congress pass my comprehensive crime bill it is tough on criminals and supportive of police and it has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now pass it help your country  and fifth i ask you tonight to fund our hope housing proposal and to pass my enterprisezone legislation which will get businesses into the inner city we must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a home getting a job becoming part of things my plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgagerevenue bonds and lowincome housing and i ask tonight for record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want move into excellence head start  step six we must reform our health care system for this too bears on whether or not we can compete in the world american health costs have been exploding this year america will spend over 800 billion on health and that is expected to grow to 16 trillion by the end of the decade we simply cannot afford this the cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell when health coverage for a fellow on the assembly line costs thousands of dollars the cost goes into the product he makes and you pay the bill now we must make a choice  now some pretend we can have it both ways they call it play or pay but that expensive approach is unstable it will mean higher taxes fewer jobs and eventually a system under complete government control really there are only two options and we can move toward a nationalized system a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the government to ration services arbitrarily and what well get is patients in long lines indifferent service and a huge new tax burden or we can reform our own private healthcare system which still gives us for all its flaws the best quality health care in the world well lets build on our strengths  my plan provides insurance security for all americans while preserving and increasing the idea of choice we make basic health insurance affordable for all lowincome people not now covered we do it by providing a healthinsurance tax credit of up to 3750 for each lowincome family the middle class gets help too and by reforming the health insurance market my plan assures that americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problem we must bring costs under control preserve quality preserve choice and reduce peoples nagging daily worry about health insurance my plan the details of which i will announce shortly does just that  and seventh we must get the federal deficit under control we now have in law enforcable spending caps and a requirement that we pay for the programs we create there are those in congress who would ease that discipline now but i cannot let them do it and i wont my plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority which means no more next year than this year i will not tamper with social security but i would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending and i would also freeze federal domestic government employment and with the help of congress my plan will get rid of 246 programs that dont deserve federal funding some of them have noble titles but none of them is indispensible we can get rid of each and every one of them  you know its time we rediscovered a home truth the american people have never forgotten the government is too big and spends too much and i call on congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of filling the budget with porkbarrel appropriations every year the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples a lawrence welk museum a research grant for belgian endive we all know how these things get into the budget and maybe you need someone to help you say no i know how to say it and you know what i need to make it stick give me the same thing 43 governors havethe lineitem vetoand let me help you control spending  we must put an end to unfinanced government mandates these are the requirements congress puts on our cities counties and states without supplying the money and if congress passes a mandate it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere after all a mandate just increases someone elses tax burden and that means higher taxes at the state and local level  step eight congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting congressional action bank reform civil justice reform tort reform and my national energy strategy  and finally we must strengthen the family because it is the family that has the greatest bearing on our future when barbara holds an aids baby in her arms and reads to children shes saying to every person in this country family matters  and i am announcing tonight a new commission on americas urban families ive asked missouris governor john ashcroft to be chairman former dallas mayor annetter strauss to be cochair you know i had mayors the leading mayors from the league of cities in the other day at the white house and they told me something striking they said that every one of them republican and democrat agreed on one thing that the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family and they asked for this commission and they were right to ask because its time to determine what we can do to keep families together strong and sound  theres one thing we can do right away ease the burden of rearing a child i ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by 500 per child for every family for a family with four kids thats an increase of 2000 this is a good start in the right direction and its what we can afford its time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans and im asking you to do just that and im asking you to allow people to use money from their iras to pay medical and educational expenses all without penalties and im asking for more ask american parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country and chances are good that pretty soon theyll get to welfare  americans are the most generous people on earth but we have to go back to the insight of franklin roosevelt who when he spoke of what became the welfare program want that it must not become a narcotic and a subtle destroyer of the spirit welfare was never meant to be a life style it was never meant to be a habit it was never supposed to be passed on from generation to generation like a legacy its time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system  states throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when ablebodied people receive government assistance they have responsibilities to the taxpayer a responsibility to seek work education or job training a responsibility to get their lives in order a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock and a responsibility to obey the law we are going to help this movement often state reform requires waiving certain federal regulations i will act to make that process easier and quicker for every state that asks our help and i want to add as we make these changes we work together to improve this system that our intention is not scapegoating and fingerpointing if you read the papers or watch tv you know theres been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness racist comments antisemitism an increased sense of division really this is not us this is not who we are and this is not acceptable  and so you have my plan for america and i am asking for big things but i believe in my heart you will do whats right  and you know its kind of an american tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions i myself have sometimes thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way through congress but you will deliberate and you will discuss and that is fine but my friends the people cannot wait they need help now and theres a mood among us people are worried there has been talk of decline someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired and i thought really go tell neil armstrong standing on the moon tell the american farmer who feeds his country and the world tell the men and women of desert storm moods come and go but greatness endures our does  and maybe for a moment its good to remember what in the dailyness of our lives we forget we are still and ever the freest nation on earth the kindest nation on earth the strongest nation on earth and we have always risen to the occasion and we are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day and those who would stop us better step aside because i look at hard times and i make this vow this will not stand and so we move on together a rising nation the once and future miracle that is still this night the hope of the world  
200, State of the Union Address, William J. Clinton,1994-01-25,  mr speaker mr president members of the 103rd congress my fellow americans  i am not sure what speech is in the teleprompter tonight but i hope we can talk about the state of the union  i ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over this chamber with such force and grace tip oneill liked to call himself a man of the house and he surely was that but even more he was a man of the people a bricklayers son who helped to build the great american middle class tip oneill never forgot who he was where he came from or who sent him here tonight hes smiling down on us for the first time from the lords gallery but in his honor may we too also remember who we are where we come from and who sent us here  if we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity quality education and a fair shot at the american dream they will do extraordinary things  we gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all nations are tested our american heritage has always been to master such change to use it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad but for too long and in too many ways that heritage was abandoned and our country drifted  for 30 years family life in america has been breaking down for 20 years the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining for the 12 years of trickle down economics we built a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national debt quadrupled from 1989 to 1992 we experienced the slowest growth in a half century for too many families even when both parents were working the american dream has been slipping away  in 1992 the american people demanded that we change i year ago i asked all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our country  well we did we replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform and i want to thank every one of you here who heard the american people who broke gridlock who gave them the most successful teamwork between a president and a congress in 30 years  accomplishments  this congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars cut spending and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest americans this congress produced tax relief for millions of lowincome workers to reward work over welfare it produced nafta it produced the brady bill now the brady law  and thank you jim brady for being here and god bless you sarah this congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of nine out of 10 small businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs it produced more research and treatment for aids more childhood immunizations more support for womens health research more affordable college loans for the middle class a new national service program for those who want to give something back to their country and their communities for higher education a dramatic increase in hightech investments to move us from a defense to a domestic hightech economy this congress produced a new lawthe motor voter billto help millions of people register to vote it produced family and medical leaveall passed all signed into law with not one single veto  these accomplishments were all commitments i made when i sought this office and in fairness they all had to be passed by you in this congress but i am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here who pay our salaries who hold our feet to the fire but what we do here is really beginning to change lives let me just give you one example  family and medical leave  i will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one father i met early one sunday morning in the white house it was unusual to see a family there touring early sunday morning but he had his wife and his three children there one of them in a wheelchair and i came up and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit i was walking off and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said mr president let me tell you something my little girl here is desperately ill shes probably not going to make it but because of the family leave law i was able to take time off to spend with her the most important i ever spent in my life without losing my job and hurting the rest of my family it means more to me than i will ever be able to say dont you people up here ever think what you do doesnt make a difference it does  though we are making a difference our work has just begun many americans still havent felt the impact of what weve done the recovery still hasnt touched every community or created enough jobs incomes are still stagnant theres still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places  abroad the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very difficult times and look to us for leadership  and so tonight let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal to create more and better jobs to guarantee health security for all to reward welfarework over welfare to promote democracy abroad and to begin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs to renew our own american community  deficit reduction  last year we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget deficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy we cut 255 billion in spending including entitlements in over 340 separate budget items we froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers  led by the vice president weve launched a campaign to reinvent government weve cut staff cut perks even trimmed the fleet of federal limousines after years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but whose actions expanded it we will actually reduce it by 252000 people over the next five years by the time we have finished the federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years  because the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts in the 1980s we did ask the wealthiest americans to pay more to reduce the deficit so on april the 15th the american people will discover the truth about what we did last year on taxes only the top onethe top 12 percent of americans as i said all along will face higher income tax rateslet me repeat only the wealthiest 12 percent of americans will face higher income tax rates and no one else will and that is the truth of course there were as there always are in politics naysayers who said this plan wouldnt work but they were wrong when i became president the experts predicted that next years deficit would be 300 billion but because we acted those same people now say the deficits going to be under 180 billion 40 percent lower than was previously predicted  the economy  our economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate and the lowest interest rates in 20 years and because those interest rates are down business investment and equipment is growing at seven times the rate of the previous four years auto sales are way up home sales at a record high millions of americans have refinanced their homes and our economy has produced 16 million privatesector jobs in 1993 more than were created in the previous four years combined  the people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early resultsproud but everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge that there is more to do next month i will send you one of the toughest budgets ever presented to congress it will cut spending in more than 300 programs eliminate 100 domestic programs and reforms the way in which governments buy goods and services  this year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard spending ceilings we have set we must do it we have proved we can bring the deficit down without choking off recovery without punishing seniors or the middle class and without putting our national security at risk if you will stick with this plan we will post three consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since harry truman lived in the white house and once again the buck stops here  trade  our economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the world once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge the world echoed with the sound of falling trade barriers in one year with nafta with gatt with our efforts in asia and the national export strategy we did more to open world markets to american products than at any time in the last two generations that means more jobs and rising living standards for the american people low deficits low inflation low interest rates low trade barriers and high investments these are the building blocks of our recovery but if we want to take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy you all know we must do more  as we reduce defense spending i ask congress to invest more in the technologies of tomorrow defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and create jobs for our people here at home  as we protect our environment we must invest in the environmental technologies of the future which will create jobs this year we will fight for a revitalized clean water act and a safe drinking water act and a reformed superfund program  and the vice president is right we must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom every clinic every library every hospital in america into a national information superhighway by the year 2000 think of it instant access to information will increase productivity it will help to educate our children it will provide better medical care it will create jobs and i call on the congress to pass legislation to establish that information superhighway this year  as we expand opportunity and create jobs no one can be left out we must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights laws because america will never be complete in its renewal until everyone shares in its bounty but we all know too we can do all these things put our economic house in order expand world trade target the jobs of the future guarantee equal opportunity  but if were honest well all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education training and skills they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow we must set tough worldclass academic and occupational standards for all our children and give our teachers and students the tools they need to meet them  education  our goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private corporations or having more public school choice to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard are our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy  goals 2000 links worldclass standards to grassroots reforms and i hope congress will pass it without delay our school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work providing at least one year of apprenticeship beyond high school after all most of the people were counting on to build our economic future wont graduate from college its time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them we must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new reemployment system the old unemployment system just sort of kept you going while you waited for your old job to come back weve got to have a new system to move people into new and better jobs because most of those old jobs just dont come back and we know that the only way to have real job security in the future to get a good job with a growing income is to have real skills and the ability to learn new ones so weve got to streamline todays patchwork of training programs and make them a source of new skill for our people who lose their jobs reemployment not unemployment must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal i urge you to pass it in this session of congress  welfare  and just as we must transform our unemployment system so must we also revolutionize our welfare system it doesnt work it defies our values as a nation if we value work we cant justify a system that makes welfare more attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health care  if we value responsibility we cant ignore the 34 billion in child support absent parents out to be paying to millions of parents who are taking care of their children if we value strong families we cant perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together can you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a grandparent thats not just bad policy its wrong and we ought to change it  i worked on this problem for years before i became president with other governors and with members of congress in both parties and with the previous administration of another party i worked on it with people who were on welfare lots of them and i want to say something to everybody here who cares about this issue the people who most want to change this system are the people who are dependent on it they want to get off welfare they want to go back to work they want to do right by their kids  i once had a hearing when i was a governor and i brought in people on welfare from all over america who had found their way to work and a woman from my state who testified was asked this question whats the best thing about being off welfare and in a job and without blinking an eye she looked at 40 governors and she said when my boy goes to school and they say what does your mother do for a living he can give an answer these people want a better system and we ought to give it to them  last year we began this we gave the states more power to innovate because we know that a lot of great ideas come from outside washington and many states are already using it then this congress took a dramatic step instead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty we helped them to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned income tax credit it will lift 15 million working families out of poverty rewarding work over welfare making it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents now thats real welfare reform  but there is more to be done this spring i will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds on the family support act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility we will say to teenagers if you have a child out of wedlock well no longer give you a check to set up a separate household we want families to stay together say to absent parents who arent paying their child support if youre not providing for your children well garnish your wages suspend your license track you across state lines and if necessary make some of you work off what you owe  people who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from them  but to all those who depend on welfare we should offer ultimately a simple compact we will provide the support the job training the child care you need for up to two years but after that anyone who can work must in the private sector wherever possible in community service if necessary thats the only way well ever make welfare what it ought to be a second chance not a way of life  i know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time we tackle health care but let me point out i think it is inevitable and imperative it is estimated that one million people are on welfare today because its the only way they can get health care coverage for their children those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health benefits and many entry level jobs dont have health benefits find themselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay for health care coverage for those who made the other choice to stay on welfare no wonder people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage weve got to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform  health care reform  so this year we will make history by reforming the health care system and i would say to you all of you my fellow public servants this is another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians  that may not be popular with either party but it happens to be the truth  you know the first lady has received now almost a million letters from people all across america and from all walks of life id like to share just one of them with you richard anderson of reno nevada lost his job and with it his health insurance two weeks later his wife judy suffered a cerebral aneurysm he rushed her to the hospital where she stayed in intensive care for 21 days the andersons bills were over 120000 although judy recovered and richard went back to work at 8 an hour the bills were too much for them and they were literally forced into bankruptcy  mrs clinton he wrote to hillary no one in the united states of america should have to lose everything theyve worked for all their lives because they were unfortunate enough to become ill it was to help the richard and judy andersons of america that the first lady and so many others have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform issue we owe them our thanks and our action  i know there are people here who say theres no health care crisis tell it to richard and judy anderson tell it to the 58 million americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year tell it to the 81 million americans with those preexisting conditions those folks are paying more or they cant get insurance at all or they cant ever change their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting conditions tell it to the small businesses burdened by skyrocketing costs of insurance most small businesses cover their employers and they pay on average 35 percent more in premiums than big businesses or government or tell it to the 76 percent of insured americans three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits and that means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the most  so if any of you believe theres no crisis you tell it to those people because i cant  there are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on peoples lives but all you have to do is go out and listen to them just go talk to them anywhere in any congressional district in this country theyre republicans and democrats and independents it doesnt have a lick to do with party they think we dont get it and its time we show that we do get it  from the day we began our health care initiative has been designed to strengthen what is good about our health care systemthe worlds best health care professionals cutting edge research and wonderful research institutions medicare for older americans none of thisnone of it should be put at risk but were paying more and more money for less and less care every year fewer and fewer americans even get to choose their doctors every year doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and less time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become  this system is riddled with inefficiency with abuse with fraud and everybody knows it in todays health care system insurance companies call the shots they pick whom they cover and how they cover them they can cut off your benefits when you need your coverage the most they are in charge  what does it mean it means every night millions of wellinsured americans go to bed just an illness an accident or a pink slip away from having no coverage or financial ruin it means every morning millions of americans go to work without any health insurance at allsomething the workers in no other advanced country in the world do it means that every year more and more hard working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss has had to pick a new plan and countless others turndown better jobs because they know if they take the better job theyll lose their health insurance  if we just let the health care system continue to drift our country will have people with less care fewer choices and higher bill  now our approach protects the quality of care and peoples choices it builds on what works today in the private sector to expand employer based coverage to guarantee private insurance for every american and i might say employer based private insurance for every american was proposed 20 years ago by president richard nixon to the united states congress it was a good idea then and its a better idea today  why do we want guaranteed private insurance because right now nine out of ten people who have insurance get it through their employersand that should continue and if your employer is providing good benefits at reasonable prices that should continue too and that ought to make the congress and the president feel better our goal is health insurance everybody can depend oncomprehensive benefits that cover preventive care and prescription drugs health premiums that dont just explode when you get sick or you get older the powerno matter how small your business is to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates that governments and big business get today one simple form for people who are sick and most of all the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor  our approach protects older americans every plan before the congress proposes to slow the growth of medicare the difference is this we believe those savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens medicare must be protected and it should cover prescription drugs and we should take the first steps in covering longterm care  to those who would cut medicare without protecting seniors i say the solution to todays squeeze on middle class working peoples health care is not to put the squeeze on middle class retired peoples health care we can do better than that when its all said and done its pretty simple to me insurance ought to mean what it used to mean you pay a fair price for security and when you get sick health care is always thereno matter what  along with the guarantee of health security we all have to admit too there must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use this system people have to take their kids to get immunized we should all take advantage of preventive care we must all work together to stop the violence that explodes our emergency rooms we have to practice better health habits and we cant abuse the system and those who dont have insurance under our approach will get coverage but they will have to pay something for it too the minority of businesses that provide no insurance at all and in so doing shift the cost of the care of their employees to others should contribute something people who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarettes everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health care crisis there cant be anymore something for nothing it will not be easy but it can be done now in the coming months i hope very much to work with both democrats and republicans to reform a health care system by using the market to bring down costs and to achieve lasting health security but if you look at history we see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform health care president roosevelt tried president truman tried president nixon tried president carter tried every time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them but not this time  campaign finance reform  i know that facing up to these interests will require courage it will raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how lobbyists yield their influence the work of change frankly will never get any easier until we limit the influence of well financed interests who profit from this current system so i also must now call on you to finish the job both houses began last year by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year  you know my fellow americans this is really a test for all of us the american people provide those of us in government service with terrific health care benefits at reasonable costs we have health care thats always there i think we need to give every hard working taxpaying american the same health care security they have already given to us  i want to make this very clear i am open as i have said repeatedly to the best ideas of concerned members of both parties i have no special brief for any specific approach even in our own bill except this if you send me legislation that does not guarantee every american private health insurance that can never be taken away you will force me to take this pen veto the legislation and well come right back here and start all over again  but i dont think thats going to happen i think were ready to act now i believe that youre ready to act now and if youre ready to guarantee every american the same health care that you have health care that can never be taken awaynow not next year or the year after now is the time to stand with the people who sent us here now  foreign policy  as we take these steps together to renew our strength at home we cannot turn away from our obligations to renew our leadership abroad this is a promising moment because of the agreements we have reached this year last year russias strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the united states nor will we point ours at them  instead of building weapons in space russian scientists will help us to build the international space station  and of course there are still dangers in the world rampant arms proliferation bitter regional conflicts ethnic and nationalist tensions in many new democracies severe environmental degradation the world over and fanatics who seek to cripple the worlds cities with terror as the worlds greatest power we must therefore maintain our defenses and our responsibilities this year we secured indictments against terrorists and sanctions against those harbor them we worked to promote environmentallysustainable economic growth we achieved agreements with ukraine with belarus with kazakhstan to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenals we are working to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons we will seek early ratification of the treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide and earlier today we joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing  but nothingnothingis more important to our security than our nations armed forces we honor their contributions including those who are carrying out the longest humanitarian airlift in history in bosnia those who will complete their mission in somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave their lives there our forces are the finest military our nation has ever had and i have pledged that as long as i am president they will remain the bestequipped the besttrained and the bestprepared fighting force on the face of the earth  defense  last year i proposed a defense plan that maintains our postcold war security at a lower cost this year many people urged me to cut our defense spending further to pay for other government programs i said no the budget i send to congress draws the line against further defense cuts it protects the readiness and quality of our forces ultimately the best strategy is to do that we must not cut defense further i hope the congress without regard to party will support that position  ultimately the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere democracies dont attack each other they make better trading partners and partners in diplomacy that is why we have supported you and i the democratic reformers in russia and in the other states of the former soviet bloc i applaud the bipartisan support this congress provided last year for our initiatives to help russia ukraine and the other states through their epic transformations  our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values we will continue to urge russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms and we will seek to cooperate with russia to solve regional problems while insisting that if russian troops operate in neighboring states they do so only when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standards  but we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures and they must chart their own futures how much more secure and more prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reform succeed all across the former communist bloc our policy has been to support that move and that has been the policy of the congress we should continue it  europe  that is why i went to europe earlier this month to work with our european partners to help to integrate all the former communist countries into a europe that has the possibility of becoming unified for the first time in its entire history its entire history based on the simple commitments of all nations in europe to democracy to free markets and to respect for existing borders  with our allies we have created a partnership for peace that invites states from the former soviet bloc and other nonnato members to work with nato in military cooperation when i met with central europes leaders including lech walesa and vaclav havel men who put their lives on the line for freedom i told them that the security of their region is important to our countrys security  this year we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human rights and sustainable development all around the world we will ask congress to ratify the new gatt accord we will continue standing by south africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy we will convene a summit of the western hemispheres democratic leaders from canada to the tip of south america and we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in haiti  and as we build a more constructive relationship with china we must continue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nations human rights record  middle east  we will also work for new progress toward the middle east peace last year the world watched yitzhak rabin and yasir arafat at the white house when they had their historic handshake of reconciliation but there is a long hard road ahead and on that road i am determined that i and our administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all the peoples of the region  now there are some in our country who argue that with the cold war america should turn its back on the rest of the world many around the world were afraid we would do just that but i took this office on a pledge that had no partisan tinge to keep our nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of the world and this year because of our work together enacting nafta keeping our military strong and prepared supporting democracy abroad we have reaffirmed americas leadership americas engagement and as a result the american people are more secure than they were before  crime  but while americans are more secure from threats abroad i think we all now that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home everyday the national peace is shattered by crime  in petaluma california an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy for the family of polly klaas an ordinary train ride on long island ends in a hail of nine millimeter rounds a tourist in florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black right here in our nations capital a brave young man named jason white a policeman the son and grandson of policemen is ruthlessly gunned down  violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society limiting personal freedom and fraying the ties that bind us  the crime bill before congress gives you a chance to do something about it a chance to be tough and smart what does that mean let me begin by saying i care a lot about this issue many years ago when i started out in public life i was the attorney general of my state i served as a governor for a dozen years i know what its like to sign laws increasing penalties to build more prison cells to carry out the death penalty i understand this issue and it is not a simple thing  first we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on parole now those who commit crimes should be punished and those who commit repeated violent crimes should be told when you commit a third violent crime you will be put away and put away for good three strikes and you are out  second we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime beginning with more police officers and more community policing we know right now that police who work the streets know the folks have the respect of the neighborhood kids focus on high crime areas we know that they are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals look at the experience of houston where the crime rate dropped 17 percent in one year when that approach was taken here tonight is one of those community policemen a brave young detective kevin jett whose beat is eight square blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in new york every day he restores some sanity and safety and a sense of values and connection to the people whose lives he protects id like to ask him to stand up and be recognized tonight  you will be given a chance to give the children of this country the law abiding working people of this country and dont forget in the toughest neighborhoods in this country in the highest crime neighborhoods in this country the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law pay their taxes do their best to raise their kids they deserve people like kevin jett and youre going to be given the chance to give the american people another 100000 of them well trained and i urge you to do it  you have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police officers which encourages retiring military personnel to move into police forcesand enormous resources for our country one which has a safe schools provisions which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets these are important things  the third thing we have to do is to build on the brady billthe brady law to take further stepsto take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals  now i want to say something about this issue hunters must always be free to hunt law abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect their homes i respect that part of our culture i grew up in it but i want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence i say to you i know you didnt create this problem but we need your help to solve it there is no sporting purpose on earth that should stop the united states congress from banishing assault weapons that outgun police and cut down children  fourth we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage of crimes recent studies indicate sadly that drug use is on the rise again among our young people the crime bill containsall the crime bills containmore money for drug treatment for criminal addicts and boot camps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and to stay off drugs our administrations budget with all its cuts contains a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education you must pass them both we need then desperately  my fellow americans the problem of violence is an unamerican problem it has no partisan or philosophical element therefore i urge you find ways as quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong smart tough crime bill  but further i urge you to consider this as you demand tougher penalties for those who choose violence let us also remember how we came to this sad point in our toughest neighborhoods on our meanest streets in our poorest rural areas we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community family and work the heart and soul of civilized society this has created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and gangs so i ask you to remember that even as we say no to crime we must give people especially our young people something to say yes to many of our initiatives from job training to welfare reform to health care to national service will help to rebuild distressed communities to strengthen families to provide work but more needs to be done thats what our community empowerment agenda is all aboutchallenging businesses to provide more investment through empowerment zones ensuring banks will make loans in the same communities their deposits come from passing legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development banks to create jobs opportunity and hope where theyre needed most  but i think you know that to really solve this problem well all have to put our heads together leave our ideological armor aside and find some new ideas to do even more  the role of government  and lets be honest we all know something else too our problems go way beyond the reach of government theyre rooted in the loss of values and the disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families and our communities my fellow americans we can cut the deficit create jobs promote democracy around the world pass welfare reform and health care pass the toughest crime bill in history and still leave too many of our people behind  the american people have got to want to change from within if were going to bring back work and family and community we cannot renew our country when within a decade more than half of the children will be born into families where there has been no marriage we cannot renew this country when 13yearold boys get semiautomatic weapons to shoot 9 year olds for kicks we cant renew our country when children are having children and the fathers walk away as if the kids dont amount to anything we cant renew the country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new customers abroad but ignore those people right here at home whod give anything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had the money to do it  we cant renew our country unless more of usi mean all of usare willing to join the churches and the other good citizens people like all the black ministers ive worked with over the years or the priests and the nuns i met at our lady of help in east los angeles or my good friend tony campolo in philadelphia unless were willing to work with people like that people who are saving kids adopting schools making streets safer all of us can do that  we cant renew our country until we realize that governments dont raise children parents do parents who know their childrens teachers and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrongthose kind of parents can make all the difference i know i had one and im telling you we have got to stop pointing our fingers at these kids who have no future and reach our hands out to them our country needs it we need it and they deserve it  and so i say to you tonight lets give our children a future let us take away their guns and give them books let us overcome their despair and replace it with hope let us by our example teach them to obey the law respect our neighbors and cherish our values let us weave these sturdy threads into a new american community that once more stand strong against the forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow  oh there will be naysayers who fear that we wont be equal to the challenges of this time but they misread our history our heritage even todays headlines all those things tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge  when the earth shook and fires raged in california when i saw the mississippi deluge the farmlands of the midwest in a 500 year flood when the centurys bitterest cold swept from north dakota to newport news it seemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams but the american people they just came together they rose to the occasion neighbor helping neighbor strangers risking life and limb to stay total strangers showing the better angels of our nature  let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters leaving our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting  let us instead by true to our spirit facing facts coming together bringing hope and moving forward  tonight my fellow americans we are summoned to answer a question as old as the republic itself what is the state of our union  it is growing stronger but it must be stronger still with your help and gods help it will be  thank you and god bless america  
201, State of the Union Address, William J. Clinton,1995-01-24,  mr president mr speaker members of the 104th congress my fellow americans  again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy and once again our democracy has spoken  so let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th congress and congratulating you mr speaker  if we agree on nothing else tonight we must agree that the american people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994  and as i look out at you i know how some of you must have felt in 1992  i must say that in both years we didnt hear america singing we heard america shouting and now all of us republicans and democrats alike must say we hear you we will work together to earn the jobs you have given us for we are the keepers of the sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era  over 200 years ago our founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  it has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that ideathe american ideaand to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times to lincoln and to his congress to preserve the union and to end slavery to theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world to franklin roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the great depression and to win our countrys great struggle against fascism  and to all our presidents since to fight the cold war especially i recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with congresses where the majority was of a different party to harry truman who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war and to ronald reagan whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism was won  in another time of change and challenge i had the honor to be the first president to be elected in the postcoldwar era an era marked by the global economy the information revolution unparalleled change in opportunity and in security for the american people  i came to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission to restore the american dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world  i was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored in this effort i am frank to say that i have made my mistakes and i have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor  but i am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was two years ago  accomplishments  record numbers record numbers of americans are succeeding in the new global economy we are at peace and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world we have almost six million new jobs since i became president and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years  our businesses are more productive and here we have worked to bring the deficit down to expand trade to put more police on our streets to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities but the rising tide is not lifting all the boats  while our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity too many of our people are still working harder and harder for less and less while our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive too many of our people still cant be sure of having a job next year or even next month and far more than our material riches are threatened things far more precious to us our children our families our values  our civil life is suffering in america today citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more the common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed  what are we to do about it  more than 60 years ago at the dawn of another new era president roosevelt told our nation new conditions impose new requirements on government and those who conduct government and from that simple proposition he shaped the new deal which helped to restore our nation to prosperity and defined the relationship between our people and their government for half a century  that approach worked in its time but today we face a very different time and very different conditions we are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility  our government once a champion of national purpose is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead the values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart  so tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time as we enter a new era we need a new set of understandings not just with government but even more important with one another as americans  new covenant  thats what i want to talk with you about tonight i call it the new covenant but its grounded in a very very old idea that all americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their godgiven talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return  opportunity and responsibilitythey go hand in hand we cant have one without the other and our national community cant hold together without both  our new covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of the new economy how we can change the way our government works to fit a different time and above all how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose we must have dramatic change in our economy our government and ourselves  my fellow americans without regard to party let us rise to the occasion let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride as we embark on this course let us put our country first remembering that regardless of party label we are all americans and let the final test of everything we do be a simple one is it good for the american people  let me begin by saying that we cannot ask americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants you made a good start by passing that law which applies to congress all the laws you put on the private sectorand i was proud to sign it yesterday  but we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of washington as were here 20 years ago the american people look at their capital and they see a city where the wellconnected and the wellprotected can work the system but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out  as the new congress opened its doors lobbyists were still doing business as usualthe gifts the tripsall the things that people are concerned about havent stopped  twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices i know there were other considerations in those votes but i want to use something that ive heard my republican friends say from time to time there doesnt have to be a law for everything  so tonight i ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists perks just stop  we dont have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the american people that things are really changing but i also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill and ill sign that too we should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what theyre spending what they want we should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of pacs  and as i have said for three years we should work to open the air waves so that they can be an instrument of democracy not a weapon of destruction by giving free tv time to candidates for public office  when the last congress killed political reform last year it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the halls of this sacred building and cheered this year lets give the folks at home something to cheer about  more important i think we all agree that we have to change the way the government works lets make it smaller less costly and smarter leaner not meaner  i just told the speaker the equal time doctrines alive and well  the role of government  the new covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter the old way of governing around here protected organized interests we should look out for the interests of ordinary people the old way divided us by interests constituency or class the new covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of whats best for our country  the old way dispensed services through large topdown inflexible bureaucracies the new covenant way should shift these resources and decision making from bureaucrats to citizens injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy  the old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure the new covenant way should have builtin incentives to reward success  the old way was centralized here in washington the new covenant way must take hold in the communities all across america and we should help them to do that  our job here is to expand opportunity not bureaucracy to empower people to make the most of their own lives and to enhance our security here at home and abroad  we must not ask government to do what we should do for ourselves we should rely on government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other  i hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem on the one hand and the other illusion that the government is the source of every problem that we have  our job is to get rid of yesterdays government so that our own people can meet todays and tomorrows needs  and we ought to do it together  you know for years before i became president i heard others say they would cut government and how bad it was but not much happened  we actually did it we cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending more than 300 domestic programs more than 100000 positions from the federal bureaucracy in the last two years alone  based on decisions already made we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the federal government making it the smallest it has been since john kennedy was president by the time i come here again next year  under the leadership of vice president gore our initiatives have already saved taxpayers  63 billion the age of the  500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on david letterman is gone deadwood programs like mohair subsidies are gone weve streamlined the agriculture department by reducing it by more than 1200 offices weve slashed the smallbusiness loan form from an inch thick to a single page weve thrown away the governments 10000page personnel manual  and the government is working better in important ways fema the federal emergency management agency has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disaster  you can ask the farmers in the middle west who fought the flood there or the people in california whove dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires and theyll tell you that  government workers working handinhand with private business rebuilt southern californias fractured freeways in record time and under budget  and because the federal government moved fast all but one of the 5600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business  now there are a lot of other things that i could talk about i want to just mention one because itll be discussed here in the next few weeks  university administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students costs the government less and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the government and for the universities  we shouldnt cap that program we should give every college in america the opportunity to be a part of it  previous government programs gather dust the reinventing government report is getting results and were not throughtheres going to be a second round of reinventing government  we propose to cut  130 billion in spending by shrinking departments extending our freeze on domestic spending cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3 getting rid of over a hundred programs we do not need like the interstate commerce commission and the helium reserve program  and were working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible the programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go we have to cut yesterdays government to help solve tomorrows problems  and we need to get government closer to the people its meant to serve we need to help move programs down to the point where states and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job if they can do it we ought to let them do it we should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better  community empowerment  taking power away from federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for its time for congress to stop passing onto the states the cost of decisions we make here in washington  i know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation but i want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interest and give justified relief where we need to give it  for years congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects last year was no different there was a million dollars to study stress in plants and  12 million for a tick removal program that didnt work its hard to remove ticks those of us whove had them know  but ill tell you something if youll give me the lineitem veto ill remove some of that unnecessary spending  but i think we should all remember and almost all of us would agree that government still has important responsibilities  our young peoplewe should think of this when we cutour young people hold our future in their hands we still owe a debt to our veterans and our senior citizens have made us what we are  budget  now my budget cuts a lot but it protects education veterans social security and medicare and i hope you will do the same thing you should and i hope you will  and when we give more flexibility to the states let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every state north and south east and west  immunization against childhood disease school lunches in all our schools head start medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infantsall these things are in the national interest  i applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations but when we deregulate lets remember what national action in the national interest has given us safer food for our families safer toys for our children safer nursing homes for our parents safer cars and highways and safer workplaces cleaner air and cleaner water do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations you bet we do but we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water we can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps and we ought to do it  should we cut the deficit more well of course we should of course we should but we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped  i know many of you in this chamber support the balancedbudget amendment i certainly want to balance the budget our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very very long time  if you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do then you have to be straight with the american people they have a right to know what youre going to cut what taxes youre going to raise how its going to affect them  and we should be doing things in the open around here for example everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger social security i would oppose that and i think most americans would  welfare  nothing is done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system this is one of the problems we have to face here in washington in our new covenant it rewards welfare over work it undermines family values it lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support it keeps a minoritybut a significant minorityof the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time  i worked on this problem for a long timenearly 15 years now as a governor i had the honor of working with the reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988  in the last two years we made a good start in continuing the work of welfare reform our administration gave two dozen states the right to slash through federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency  last year i introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration we have to make welfare what it was meant to bea second chance not a way of life  we have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible to provide child care and teach them skills if thats what they need for up to two years but after that there ought to be a simple hard rule anyone who can work must go to work  if a parent isnt paying child support they should be forced to pay  we should suspend drivers licenses track them across state lines make them work off what they owe that is what we should do governments do not raise children people do and the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world  i want to work with you with all of you to pass welfare reform but our goal must be to liberate people and lift them from dependence to independence from welfare to work from mere childbearing to responsible parenting our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor  we shouldwe should require work and mutual responsibility but we shouldnt cut people off just because theyre poor theyre young or even because theyre unmarried we should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings by requiring them to finish school but we shouldnt put them and their children out on the street  and i know all the arguments pro and con and i have read and thought about this for a long time i still dont think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents  my fellow americans every single survey shows that all the american people care about this without regard to party or race or region so let this be the year we end welfare as we know it  but also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide america  no one is more eager to end welfare  i may be the only president whos actually had the opportunity to sit in the welfare office whos actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare and i am telling you the people who are trapped on it know it doesnt work they also want to get off  so we can promote together education and work and good parenting i have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent i just dont want to punish poverty and past mistakes all of us have made our mistakes and none of us can change our yesterdays but every one of us can change our tomorrows  and americas best example of that may be lynn woolsey who worked her way off welfare to become a congresswoman from the state of california  crime  i know the members of this congress are concerned about crime as are all the citizens of our country but i remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime billlonger sentences three strikes and youre out almost 60 new capital punishment offenses more prisons more prevention 100000 more policeand we paid for it all by reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate  there may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime to be smarter with crime to help to lower that rate first well if there are lets talk about them and lets do them but lets not go back on the things that we did last year that we know workthat we know work because the local lawenforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing because local community leaders whove worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work  lets look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it and if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate and i am convinced that it does let us not go back on it lets stick with it implement itweve got four more hard years of work to do to do that  i dont want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight but i have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year the last congress also passed the brady bill and in the crime bill the ban on 19 assault weapons  i dont think its a secret to anybody in this room that several members of the last congress who voted for that arent here tonight because they voted for it and i know therefore that some of you that are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it i just have to tell you how i feel about it  the members who voted for that bill and i would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities ive done it since i was a boy and im going to keep right on doing it until i cant do it anymore  but a lot of people laid down their seats in congress so that police officers and kids wouldnt have to lay down their lives under a hail of assaultweapon attacks and i will not let that be repealed i will not let it be repealed  id like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with i want us to cut more spending but i hope we wont cut government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy promote responsibility and are organized from the grass roots up not by federal bureaucracy  the very best example of this is the national service corpsamericorps it passed with strong bipartisan support and now there are 20000 americans more than ever served in one year in the peace corpsworking all over this country helping person to person in local grassroots volunteer groups solving problems and in the process earning some money for their education  this is citizenship at its best its good for the americorps members but its good for the rest of us too its the essence of the new covenant and we shouldnt stop it  illegal immigration  all americans not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country  the jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants the public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers thats why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before by cracking down on illegal hiring by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens  in the budget i will present to you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former congresswoman barbara jordan  we are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws it is wrong and ultimately selfdefeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years and we must do more to stop it  the most important job of our government in this new era is to empower the american people to succeed in the global economy america has always been a land of opportunity a land where if you work hard you can get ahead weve become a great middleclass country middleclass values sustain us we must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass even as we do everything we can to support the millions of americans who are already successful in the new economy  america is once again the worlds strongest economic power almost six million new jobs in the last two years exports booming inflation down highwage jobs are coming back a record number of american entrepreneurs are living the american dream  if we want it to stay that way those who work and lift our nation must have more of its benefits  today too many of those people are being left out theyre working harder for less they have less security less income less certainty that they can even afford a vacation much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves  we cannot let this continue if we dont act our economy will probably keep doing what its been doing since about 1978 when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward no matter how hard they worked  weve got to have a government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people a government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills  education  thats why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last two years from head start to public schools to apprenticeships for young people who dont go to college to making college loans more available and more affordable  thats the first thing we have to do weve got to do something to empower people to improve their skills  taxes  second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes  we took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under  27000 a tax cut that this year will average about  1000 a family  and we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses before we could do more than that we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited and we had to get economic growth up now weve done both and now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way  but tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives the spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves their families and their communities  middle class bill of rights  i have proposed a middleclass bill of rights which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves it will therefore give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us  there are four provisions  first a tax deduction for all education and training after high school if you think about it we permit businesses to deduct their investment we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages but today an education is even more important to the economic wellbeing of our whole country than even those things are we should do everything we can to encourage it and i hope you will support it  second we ought to cut taxes  500 for families with children under 13  third we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education health care firsttime home buying or the care of a parent  and fourth we should pass a gi bill for americas workers we propose to collapse nearly 70 federal programs and not give the money to the states but give the money directly to the american people offer vouchers to them so that theyif theyre laid off or if theyre working for a very low wagecan get a voucher worth  2600 a year for up to two years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives lets empower people in this way move it from the government directly to the workers of america  cutting the deficit now  any one of us can call for a tax cut but i wont accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk we ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly just two years ago it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit  thanks to the courage of the people who were here then many of whom didnt return we did cut the deficit we began to do what others said would not be done we cut the deficit by over  600 billion about  10000 for every family in this country its coming down three years in a row for the first time since mr truman was president and i dont think anybody in america wants us to let it explode again  in the budget i will send you the middleclass bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy cuts in programs cuts in special interest subsidies and the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts my budget pays for the middleclass bill of rights without any cuts in medicare and i will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with medicare cuts thats not the right thing to do  i know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief and some of them i find quite interesting i really want to work with all of you  my tests for our proposals will be will it create jobs and raise incomes will it strengthen our families and support our children is it paid for will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass  if it does ill support it but if it doesnt i wont  minimum wage  the goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why i believe that you should raise the minimum wage  it rewards worktwo and a half million americans often women with children are working out there today for fourandaquarter an hour in terms of real buying power by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40year low thats not my idea of how the new economy ought to work  now i studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimumwage increase i believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market but the most important thing is you cant make a living on  425 an hour now especially if you have children even with the working families tax cut we passed last year  in the past the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue and i think it should be again so i want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage  members of congress have been here less than a month but by the end of the week28 days into the new yearevery member of congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimumwage worker makes all year long  everybody else here including the president has something else that too many americans do without and thats health care  health care  now last year we almost came to blows over health care but we didnt do anything and the cold hard fact is that since last yearsince i was hereanother 11 million americans in working families have lost their health care and the cold hard fact is that many millions moremost of them farmers and small business people and selfemployed peoplehave seen their premiums skyrocket their copays and deductibles go up  theres a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what theyve got is a piece of paper that says they wont lose their home if they get sick  now i still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every american family butbut i know that last year as the evidence indicates we bit off more than we could chew  so im asking you that we work together lets do it step by step lets do whatever we have to do to get something done lets at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no american risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices but that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick  i want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this with the democrats who worked on it last time with the republican leaders like senator dole who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year we ought to make sure that selfemployed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools we ought to help families provide longterm care for a sick parent to a disabled child we can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work and we can find a wayit may take some time but we can find a wayto make sure that our children have health care  you know i think everybody in this room without regard to party can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the worlds most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade but we cant be proud of the fact that were the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years agothe last time we were the most productive economy in the world  so lets work together on this it is too important for politics as usual  much of what the american people are thinking about tonight is what weve already talked about a lot of people think that the security concerns of america today are entirely internal to our borders they relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children our streets our health and protecting those borders  foreign policy  now that the cold war has passed its tempting to believe that all the security issues with the possible exception of trade reside here at home but its not so our security still depends on our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy we still cant be strong at home unless were strong abroad  mexico  the financial crisis in mexico is a case in point i know its not popular to say it tonight but we have to act not for the mexican people but for the sake of the millions of americans whose livelihoods are tied to mexicos wellbeing if we want to secure american jobs preserve american exports safeguard americas borders then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put mexico back on track  now let me repeat its not a loan its not foreign aid its not a bailout well be given a guarantee like cosigning a note with good collateral that will cover our risk  this legislation is the right thing for america thats why the bipartisan leadership has supported it and i hope you in congress will pass it quickly it is in our interest and we can explain it to the american people because were going to do it in the right way  russia  you know tonight this is the first state of the union address ever delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single russian missile is pointed at the children of america  and along with the russians were on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9000 nuclear warheads weve come so far so fast in this postcoldwar world that its easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted but its still there and we arent finished yet  this year ill ask the senate to approve start ii to eliminate weapons that carry 5000 more warheads the united states will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the nuclear nonproliferation treaty to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban and to eliminate chemical weapons  north korea  to stop and roll back north koreas potentially deadly nuclear program well continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation its smart its tough its a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves  this year ill submit to congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists whether they strike at home or abroad as the cowards who bombed the world trade center found out this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice  middle east  just this week another horrendous terrorist act in israel killed 19 and injured scores more on behalf of the american people and all of you i send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims i know that in the face of such evil it is hard for the people in the middle east to go forward but the terrorists represent the past not the future we must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between israel and all her neighbors in the middle east  accordingly last night i signed an executive order that will block the assets in the united states of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process it prohibits financial transactions with these groups  and tonight i call on all our allies in peaceloving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism we cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis  defense  from the day i took the oath of office i pledged that our nation would maintain the bestequipped besttrained and bestprepared military on earth we have and they are they have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit but to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve im asking the congress to add  25 billion in defense spending over the next six years  i have visited many bases at home and around the world since i became president tonight i repeat that request with renewed conviction we ask a very great deal of our armed forces now that they are smaller in number we ask more of them they go out more often to more different places and stay longer they are called to service in many many ways and we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned  just think about what our troops have done in the last year showing america at its best helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in rwanda moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to kuwait giving freedom and democracy back to the people of haiti  we have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from south africa to northern ireland from central and eastern europe to asia from latin america to the middle east all these endeavors are good in those places but they make our future more confident and more secure  well my fellow americans thats my agenda for americas future expanding opportunity not bureaucracy enhancing security at home and abroad empowering our people to make the most of their own lives  its ambitious and achievable but its not enough  we even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping americans to compete in the new economy more than a government thats smaller smarter and wiser more than all the changes we can make in government and in the private sector from the outside in  values and voices  our fortunes and our prosperity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from withinfrom the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families for our communities and yes for our fellow citizens  we see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart and we feel the common ground shifting from under us the pta the town hall meeting the ball parkits hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation  too many of our children dont even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity we all know that while we here in this chamber can make a difference on those things that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens where they work and where they live  and itll be made almost without regard to party when i used to go to the softball park in little rock to watch my daughters league and people would come up to mefathers and mothersand talk to me i can honestly say i had no idea whether 90 percent of them were republicans or democrats  when i visited the relief centers after the floods in california northern california last week a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do she hugged me and said mr president im a republican but im glad youre here  now why we cant wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day because as we move into this next century everybody matters we dont have a person to waste and a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better  that means that we need a new covenant for everybodyfor our corporate and business leaders were going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down to expand markets to support their success in every possible way but they have an obligation when theyre doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate  for people in the entertainment industry in this country we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success and we support your freedom of expression but you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant repetitive mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time  weve got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage i have sent to congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work but government can only do so much tonight i call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference we can do this and we must  and i would like to say a special word to our religious leaders you know im proud of the fact that the united states has more house of worship per capita than any country in the world these people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action can reach out to all of our children to all of the people in distress to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference they have a role in the new covenant as well  there must be more responsibility for all of our citizens you know it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school it takes a lot of people to build the habitat for humanity houses that the speaker celebrates on his lapel pin it takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids it takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be  i know its hard when youre working harder for less when youre under great stress to do these things a lot of our people dont have the time or the emotional stress they think to do the work of citizenship most of us in politics havent helped very much for years weve mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the tv adseither promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations and more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that is hardly conducive to honest and open conversations but the truth is we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views  if you go back to the beginning of this country the great strength of america as de tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground and in this day everybody has a responsibility to do more of that we simply cannot wait for a tornado a fire or a flood to behave like americans ought to behave in dealing with one another  i want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the first lady that represent what im trying to talk about citizens i have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election but they represent what we ought to be doing  cindy perry teaches secondgraders to read in americorps in rural kentucky she gains when she gives shes a mother of four  she says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year she was married when she was a teenager stand up cindy she married when she was a teenager she had four children but she had time to serve other people to get her high school equivalency and shes going to use her americorps money to go back to college  steven bishop is the police chief of kansas city hes been a national leaderstand up steve hes been a national leader in using more police in community policing and hes worked with americorps to do it and the crime rate in kansas city has gone down as a result of what he did  cpl gregory depestre went to haiti as part of his adopted countrys force to help secure democracy in his native land and i might add we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to haiti and taken haitianamericans there who could speak the language and talk to the people and he was one of them and were proud of him  the next two folks ive had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit the rev john and the rev diana cherry of the ame zion church in temple hills md id like to ask them to stand i want to tell you about them in the early 80s they left government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house in the early 80s today that church has 17000 members it is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire united states it grows by 200 a month  they do it together and the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together they aretwo things they did make a big impression on me i visited their church once and i learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the washington dc line in a highercrime higherdrugrate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them second thing i want to say is that once reverend cherry was at a meeting at the white house with some other religious leaders and he left early to go back to his church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over america to convince them to come back together to save their marriages and to raise their kids this is the kind of work that citizens are doing in america we need more of it and it ought to be lifted up and supported  the last person i want to introduce is jack lucas from hattiesburg mississippi jack would you stand up fifty years ago in the sands of iwo jima jack lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship on february the 20th 1945 he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet jack lucas threw himself on both of them in that moment he saved the lives of his companions and miraculously in the next instant a medic saved his life he gained a foothold for freedom and at the age of 17 just a year older than his grandson whos up there with him today and his son who is a west point graduate and a veteran at 17 jack lucas became the youngest marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the congressional medal of honor all these years later yesterday heres what he said about that day didnt matter where you were from or who you were you relied on one another you did it for your country we all gain when we give and we reap what we sow thats at the heart of this new covenant responsibility opportunity and citizenship  more than stale chapters in some remote civic book theyre still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our godgiven potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country the enduring dream from that first and mostsacred covenant i believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our creator the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  this is a very very great country and our best days are still to come thank you and god bless you all  
202, State of the Union Address, William J. Clinton,1996-01-23,  mr speaker mr vice president members of the 104th congress distinguished guests my fellow americans all across our land  let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform around the world and especially those helping peace take root in bosnia and to their families i thank you america is very very proud of you  my duty tonight is to report on the state of the unionnot the state of our government but of our american community and to set forth our responsibilities in the words of our founders to form a more perfect union  the state of the union is strong our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades we have the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years we have created nearly 8 million new jobs over a million of them in basic industries like construction and automobiles america is selling more cars than japan for the first time since the 1970s and for three years in a row we have had a record number of new businesses started in our country  our leadership in the world is also strong bringing hope for new peace and perhaps most important we are gaining ground in restoring our fundamental values the crime rate the welfare and food stamp rolls the poverty rate and the teen pregnancy rate are all down and as they go down prospects for americas future go up  we live in an age of possibility a hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory now we move to an age of technology information and global competition these changes have opened vast new opportunities for our people but they have also presented them with stiff challenges while more americans are living better too many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up and they are rightly concerned about the security of their families  the role of government  we must answer here three fundamental questions first how do we make the american dream of opportunity for all a reality for all americans who are willing to work for it second how do we preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future and third how do we meet these challenges together as one america  we know big government does not have all the answers we know theres not a program for every problem we have worked to give the american people a smaller less bureaucratic government in washington and we have to give the american people one that lives within its means  the era of big government is over but we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves instead we must go forward as one america one nation working together to meet the challenges we face together selfreliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues we must have both  i believe our new smaller government must work in an oldfashioned american way together with all of our citizens through state and local governments in the workplace in religious charitable and civic associations our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of their own liveswith stronger families more educational opportunity economic security safer streets a cleaner environment in a safer world  to improve the state of our union we must ask more of ourselves we must expect more of each other and we must face our challenges together  here in this place our responsibility begins with balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all americans there is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end  i compliment the republican leadership and the membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this task of balancing the budget and i thank the democrats for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993 which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in three years  deficit  since 1993 we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit reduction lower interest rates have made it easier for businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs lower interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages car payments and credit card rates to ordinary citizens now it is time to finish the job and balance the budget  though differences remain among us which are significant the combined total of the proposed savings that are common to both plans is more than enough using the numbers from your congressional budget office to balance the budget in seven years and to provide a modest tax cut  these cuts are real they will require sacrifice from everyone but these cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents our children and our future by endangering medicare or medicaid or education or the environment or by raising taxes on working families  i have said before and let me say again many good ideas have come out of our negotiations i have learned a lot about the way both republicans and democrats view the debate before us i have learned a lot about the good ideas that we could all embrace  we ought to resolve our remaining differences i am willing to work to resolve them i am ready to meet tomorrow but i ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that both plans have in common and give the american people their balanced budget a tax cut lower interest rates and a brighter future we should do that now and make permanent deficits yesterdays legacy  now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and tomorrow beyond the burdens of yesterday the challenges are significant but america was built on challenges not promises and when we work together to meet them we never fail that is the key to a more perfect union our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts  tonight i want to speak to you about the challenges we all face as a people  strengthening families  our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen americas families family is the foundation of american life if we have stronger families we will have a stronger america  before i go on i would like to take just a moment to thank my own family and to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and childrena wonderful wife a magnificent mother and a great first lady thank you hillary  all strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our children i have heard mrs gore say that its hard to be a parent today but its even harder to be a child so all of us not just as parents but all of us in our other rolesour media our schools our teachers our communities our churches and synagogues our businesses our governmentsall of us have a responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most of their lives and their godgiven capacities  to the media i say you should create movies and cds and television shows youd want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy  i call on congress to pass the requirement for a vchip in tv sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children when parents control what their young children see that is not censorship that is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their childrens upbringing and i urge them to do it the vchip requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now pending in this congress it has bipartisan support and i urge you to pass it now  to make the vchip work i challenge the broadcast industry to do what movies have doneto identify your programming in ways that help parents to protect their children and i invite the leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to come to the white house next month to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television i am ready to work with you  i say to those who make and market cigarettes every year a million children take up smoking even though it is against the law three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened as a result our administration has taken steps to stop the massive marketing campaigns that appeal to our children we are simply saying market your products to adults if you wish but draw the line on children  i say to those who are on welfare and especially to those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time for too long our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work instead of supporting them the congress and i are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform we agree on time limits tough work requirements and the toughest possible child support enforcement but i believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is happening to their children  i challenge this congress to send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing by our children i will sign it immediately  let us be candid about this difficult problem passing a law even the best possible law is only a first step the next step is to make it work i challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for independence i challenge american businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work force i applaud the work of religious groups and others who care for the poor more than anyone else in our society they know the true difficulty of the task before us and they are in a position to help every one of us should join them that is the only way we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the american people  to strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen pregnancy rate going down i am gratified as im sure all americans are that it has dropped for two years in a row but we all know it is still far too high  tonight i am pleased to announce that a group of prominent americans is responding to that challenge by forming an organization that will support grassroots community efforts all across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy and i challenge all of us and every american to join their efforts  i call on american men and women in families to give greater respect to one another we must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our country and i challenge americas families to work harder to stay together for families who stay together not only do better economically their children do better as well  in particular i challenge the fathers of this country to love and care for their children if your family has separated you must pay your child support were doing more than ever to make sure you do and were going to do more but lets all admit something about that too a check will not substitute for a parents love and guidance and only youonly you can make the decision to help raise your children no matter who you are how low or high your station in life it is the most basic human duty of every american to do that job to the best of his or her ability  education  our second challenge is to provide americans with the educational opportunities we will all need for this new century in our schools every classroom in america must be connected to the information superhighway with computers and good software and welltrained teachers we are working with the telecommunications industry educators and parents to connect 20 percent of californias classrooms by this spring and every classroom and every library in the entire united states by the year 2000 i ask congress to support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure this national partnership succeeds  every diploma ought to mean something i challenge every community every school and every state to adopt national standards of excellence to measure whether schools are meeting those standards to cut bureaucratic red tape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility for grassroots reform and to hold them accountable for results thats what our goals 2000 initiative is all about  i challenge every state to give all parents the right to choose which public school their children will attend and to let teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job  i challenge all our schools to teach character education to teach good values and good citizenship and if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms  i challenge our parents to become their childrens first teachers turn off the tv see that the homework is done and visit your childrens classroom no program no teacher no one else can do that for you  my fellow americans higher education is more important today than ever before weve created a new student loan program thats made it easier to borrow and repay those loans and we have dramatically cut the student loan default rate thats something we should all be proud of because it was unconscionably high just a few years ago through americorps our national service program this year 25000 young people will earn college money by serving their local communities to improve the lives of their friends and neighbors these initiatives are right for america and we should keep them going  and we should also work hard to open the doors of college even wider i challenge congress to expand workstudy and help one million young americans work their way through college by the year 2000 to provide a 1000 merit scholarship for the top five percent of graduates in every high school in the united states to expand pell grant scholarships for deserving and needy students and to make up to 10000 a year of college tuition tax deductible its a good idea for america  our third challenge is to help every american who is willing to work for it achieve economic security in this new age people who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new economy they need education and training for a lifetime they need more support for families raising children they need retirement security they need access to health care more and more americans are finding that the education of their childhood simply doesnt last a lifetime  gi bill for workers  so i challenge congress to consolidate 70 overlapping antiquated jobtraining programs into a simple voucher worth 2600 for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition or other training this is a gi bill for americas workers we should all be able to agree on  more and more americans are working hard without a raise congress sets the minimum wage within a year the minimum wage will fall to a 40year low in purchasing power four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer a living wage but millions of americans and their children are trying to live on it i challenge you to raise their minimum wage  in 1993 congress cut the taxes of 15 million hardpressed working families to make sure that no parents who work fulltime would have to raise their children in poverty and to encourage people to move from welfare to work this expanded earned income tax credit is now worth about 1800 a year to a family of four living on 20000 the budget bill i vetoed would have reversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these people we should not do that  i also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to do a good job raising their children and at work i agree that we need a tax credit for working families with children thats one of the things most of us in this chamber i hope can agree on i know it is strongly supported by the republican majority and it should be part of any final budget agreement  i want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide pensions for your employees and i challenge congress to pass a proposal recommended by the white house conference on small business that would make it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish their own pension plans that is something we should all agree on  we should also protect existing pension plans two years ago with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more congress should not now let companies endanger those workers pension funds i know the proposal to liberalize the ability of employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would raise money for the treasury but i believe it is false economy i vetoed that proposal last year and i would have to do so again  health care  finally if our working families are going to succeed in the new economy they must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick over the past two years over one million americans in working families have lost their health insurance we have to do more to make health care available to every american and congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by senator kennedy and senator kassebaum that would require insurance companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs and stop denying coverage for preexisting conditions lets all do that  and even as we enact savings in these programs we must have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of medicare and medicaidnot just to the poor but to people in working families including children people with disabilities people with aids and senior citizens in nursing homes  in the past three years weve saved 15 billion just by fighting health care fraud and abuse we have all agreed to save much more we have all agreed to stabilize the medicare trust fund but we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who need medicare and medicaid america cannot become stronger if they become weaker  the gi bill for workers tax relief for education and child rearing pension availability and protection access to health care preservation of medicare and medicaidthese things along with the family and medical leave act passed in 1993these things will help responsible hardworking american families to make the most of their own lives  but employers and employees must do their part as well as they are doing in so many of our finest companiesworking together putting the longterm prosperity ahead of the shortterm gain as workers increase their hours and their productivity employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share the benefits of the good years as well as the burdens of the bad ones when companies and workers work as a team they do better and so does america  crime  our fourth great challenge is to take our streets back from crime and gangs and drugs at last we have begun to find a way to reduce crime forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch criminals and prevent crime this strategy called community policing is clearly working violent crime is coming down all across america in new york city murders are down 25 percent in st louis 18 percent in seattle 32 percent but we still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our people are free from fear  the crime bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing it provides funds for 100000 new police in communities of all sizes were already a third of the way there and i challenge the congress to finish the job let us stick with a strategy thats working and keep the crime rate coming down  community policing also requires bonds of trust between citizens and police i ask all americans to respect and support our law enforcement officers and to our police i say our children need you as role models and heroes dont let them down  the brady bill has already stopped 44000 people with criminal records from buying guns the assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs i challenge the congress to keep those laws on the books  our next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the mob im directing the fbi and other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles in violent crime and to seek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like adults  and i challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants from now on the rule for residents who commit crime and peddle drugs should be one strike and youre out  i challenge every state to match federal policy to assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence  more police and punishment are important but theyre not enough we have got to keep more of our young people out of trouble with prevention strategies not dictated by washington but developed in communities i challenge all of our communities all of our adults to give our children futures to say yes to and i challenge congress not to abandon the crime bills support of these grassroots prevention efforts  finally to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem the challenge begins in our homes with parents talking to their children openly and firmly it embraces our churches and synagogues our youth groups and our schools  i challenge congress not to cut our support for drugfree schools people like the dare officers are making a real impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time comes  meanwhile we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into america for the last two years one man in particular has been on the front lines of that effort tonight i am nominating hima hero of the persian gulf war and the commander in chief of the united states military southern commandgeneral barry mccaffrey as americas new drug czar  general mccaffrey has earned three purple hearts and two silver stars fighting for this country tonight i ask that he lead our nations battle against drugs at home and abroad to succeed he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before he needs all of us every one of us has a role to play on this team  thank you general mccaffrey for agreeing to serve your country one more time  environment  our fifth challenge to leave our environment safe and clean for the next generation because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have cleaner water and air lead levels in childrens blood has been cut by 70 percent toxic emissions from factories cut in half lake erie was dead and now its a thriving resource but 10 million children under 12 still live within four miles of a toxic waste dump a third of us breathe air that endangers our health and in too many communities the water is not safe to drink we still have much to do  yet congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent that means more toxic chemicals in our water more smog in our air more pesticides in our food lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook i challenge congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them  this issue has not been a partisan issue the most significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under a democratic congress and president richard nixon we can work together we have to believe some basic things do you believe we can expand the economy without hurting the environment i do do you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment up i know we can that should be our commitment  we must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment and we have to make it easier for them to do it to businesses this administration is saying if you can find a cheaper more efficient way than government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards do itas long as you do it right to communities we say we must strengthen community righttoknow laws requiring polluters to disclose their emissions but you have to use the information to work with business to cut pollution people do have a right to know that their air and their water are safe  foreign policy  our sixth challenge is to maintain americas leadership in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world because of american leadership more people than ever before live free and at peace and americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security  we owe thanks especially to our veterans of world war ii i would like to say to senator bob dole and to all others in this chamber who fought in world war ii and to all others on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our conflicts since i salute your service and so do the american people  all over the world even after the cold war people still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of peace and freedom but as the cold war fades into memory voices of isolation say america should retreat from its responsibilities i say they are wrong  the threats we face today as americans respect no nations borders think of them terrorism the spread of weapons of mass destruction organized crime drug trafficking ethnic and religious hatred aggression by rogue states environmental degradation if we fail to address these threats today we will suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows  of course we cant be everywhere of course we cant do everything but where our interests and our values are at stake and where we can make a difference america must lead we must not be isolationist  we must not be the worlds policeman but we can and should be the worlds very best peacemaker by keeping our military strong by using diplomacy where we can and force where we must by working with others to share the risk and the cost of our efforts america is making a difference for people here and around the world for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age there is not a single russian missile pointed at americas children  north korea  north korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program in haiti the dictators are gone democracy has a new day the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided through tougher trade deals for americaover 80 of themwe have opened markets abroad and now exports are at an alltime high growing faster than imports and creating good american jobs  northern ireland  we stood with those taking risks for peace in northern ireland where catholic and protestant children now tell their parents violence must never return in the middle east where arabs and jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share knowledge and resources and even dreams  bosnia  and we stood up for peace in bosnia remember the skeletal prisoners the mass graves the campaign to rape and torture the endless lines of refugees the threat of a spreading war all these threats all these horrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace now our troops and a strong nato together with our new partners from central europe and elsewhere are helping that peace to take hold  as all of you know i was just there with a bipartisan congressional group and i was so proud not only of what our troops were doing but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing they knew what americas mission in this world is and they were proud to be carrying it out  through these efforts we have enhanced the security of the american people but make no mistake about it important challenges remain  russia  the start ii treaty with russia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by another 25 percent i urge the senate to ratify itnow we must end the race to create new nuclear weapons by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treatythis year  as we remember what happened in the japanese subway we can outlaw poison gas forever if the senate ratifies the chemical weapons conventionthis year we can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad if congress passes the antiterrorism legislation i proposed after the oklahoma city bombingnow we can help more people move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if congress gives us the means to remain the worlds leader for peace  my fellow americans the six challenges i have just discussed are for all of us our seventh challenge is really americas challenge to those of us in this hallowed hall tonight to reinvent our government and make our democracy work for them  reform  last year this congress applied to itself the laws it applies to everyone else this congress banned gifts and meals from lobbyists this congress forced lobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill this congress did that and i applaud you for it  now i challenge congress to go furtherto curb special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign reform bill in a generation you republicans and democrats alike can show the american people that we can limit spending and open the airwaves to all candidates  i also appeal to congress to pass the lineitem veto you promised the american people  our administration is working hard to give the american people a government that works better and costs less thanks to the work of vice president gore we are eliminating 16000 pages of unnecessary rules and regulations shifting more decisionmaking out of washington back to states and local communities  as we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller government we must work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own lives we are helping americas communities not with more bureaucracy but with more opportunities through our successful empowerment zones and community development banks we are helping people to find jobs to start businesses and with tax incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property we can bring jobs back to places that desperately desperately need them  but there are some areas that the federal government should not leave and should address and address strongly one of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration after years of neglect this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders we are increasing border controls by 50 percent we are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants and tonight i announce i will sign an executive order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants  let me be very clear about this we are still a nation of immigrants we should be proud of it we should honor every legal immigrant here working hard to become a new citizen but we are also a nation of laws  i want to say a special word now to those who work for our federal government today our federal government is 200000 employees smaller than it was the day i took office as president  our federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years and its getting smaller every day most of our fellow americans probably dont know that and there is a good reason the remaining federal work force is composed of americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever before to make sure the quality of our services does not decline  id like to give you one example his name is richard dean he is a 49 yearold vietnam veteran whos worked for the social security administration for 22 years now last year he was hard at work in the federal building in oklahoma city when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him he reentered that building four times he saved the lives of three women hes here with us this evening and i want to recognize richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism  but richard deans story doesnt end there this last november he was forced out of his office when the government shut down and the second time the government shut down he continued helping social security recipients but he was working without pay  on behalf of richard dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the american people i challenge all of you in this chamber never ever shut the federal government down again  on behalf of all americans especially those who need their social security payments at the beginning of march i also challenge the congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the united statesto honor the obligations of this great nation as we have for 220 years to rise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people america keeps its word  i know that this evening i have asked a lot of congress and even more from america but i am confident when americans work together in their homes their schools their churches their synagogues their civic groups their workplace they can meet any challenge  i say again the era of big government is over but we cant go back to the era of fending for yourself we have to go forward to the era of working together as a community as a team as one america with all of us reaching across these lines that divide usthe division the discrimination the rancorwe have to reach across it to find common ground we have got to work together if we want america to work  i want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that lucius wright is a teacher in the jackson mississippi public school system a vietnam veteran he has created groups to help innercity children turn away from gangs and build futures they can believe in sergeant jennifer rodgers is a police officer in oklahoma city like richard dean she helped to pull her fellow citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy she reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of oklahoma city lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and community  lucius wright and jennifer rodgers are special americans and i have the honor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several thousand americans who will be chosen to carry the olympic torch on its long journey from los angeles to the centennial of the modern olympics in atlanta this summernot because they are star athletes but because they are star citizens community heroes meeting americas challenges they are our real champions  now each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own lives none of us can finish the race alone we can only achieve our destiny togetherone hand one generation one american connecting to another  there have always been things we could do togetherdreams we could make realwhich we could never have done on our own we americans have forged our identity our very union from every point of view and every point on the planet every different opinion but we must be bound together by a faith more powerful than any doctrine that divides usby our belief in progress our love of liberty and our relentless search for common ground  america has always sought and always risen to every challenge who would say that having come so far together we will not go forward from here who would say that this age of possibility is not for all americans  our country is and always has been a great and good nation but the best is yet to come if we all do our part  thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america thank you  
203, State of the Union Address, William J. Clinton,1997-02-04,  mr speaker mr vice president members of the 105th congress distinguished guests my fellow americans  i think i should start by saying thanks for inviting me back  i come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our peacetime historyand a plan of action to meet that challenge to prepare our people for the bold new world of the 21st century  we have much to be thankful for with four years of growth we have won back the basic strength of our economy with crime and welfare rolls declining we are winning back our optimism the enduring faith that we can master any difficulty with the cold war receding and global commerce at record levels we are helping to win an unrivaled peace and prosperity all across the world  my fellow americans the state of our union is strong but now we must rise to the decisive moment to make a nation and a world better than any we have ever known  the new promise of the global economy the information age unimagined new work lifeenhancing technologyall these are ours to seize that is our honor and our challenge we must be shapers of events not observers for if we do not act the moment will pass and we will lose the best possibilities of our future  we face no imminent threat but we do have an enemy the enemy of our time is inaction  so tonight i issue a call to actionaction by this congress action by our states by our people to prepare america for the 21st century action to keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all our people action to strengthen education and harness the forces of technology and science action to build stronger families and stronger communities and a safer environment action to keep america the worlds strongest force for peace freedom and prosperity and above all action to build a more perfect union here at home  the spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference  we must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all americans responsibility from all americans in a community of all americans and we must be committed to a new kind of government not to solve all our problems for us but to give our peopleall our peoplethe tools they need to make the most of their own lives and we must work together  the people of this nation elected us all they want us to be partners not partisans they put us all right here in the same boat they gave us all oars and they told us to row now here is the direction i believe we should take  first we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our country to balance the budget renew our democracy and finish the job of welfare reform  over the last four years we have brought new economic growth by investing in our people expanding our exports cutting our deficits creating over 11 million new jobs a fouryear record  now we must keep our economy the strongest in the world we here tonight have an historic opportunity let this congress be the congress that finally balances the budget thank you  in two days i will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by 2002 this plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while protecting medicare medicaid education and the environment it will balance the budget and build on the vice presidents efforts to make our government work bettereven as it costs less  it will balance the budget and provide middleclass tax relief to pay for education and health care to help to raise a child to buy and sell a home  balancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature it does not require us to rewrite our constitution i believe i believe it is both unnecessary unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted results such as judges halting social security checks or increasing taxes  let us at least agree we should not pass any measure no measure should be passed that threatens social security we dont need whatever your view on that we all must concede we dont need a constitutional amendment we need action whatever our differences we should balance the budget now and then for the longterm health of our society we must agree to a bipartisan process to preserve social security and reform medicare for the long run so that these fundamental programs will be as strong for our children as they are for our parents  and let me say something thats not in my script tonight i know this is not going to be easy but i really believe one of the reasons the american people gave me a second term was to take the tough decisions in the next four years that will carry our country through the next 50 years i know it is easier for me than for you to say or do but another reason i was elected is to support all of you without regard to party to give you what is necessary to join in these decisions we owe it to our country and to our future  our second piece of unfinished business requires us to commit ourselves tonight before the eyes of america to finally enacting bipartisan campaign finance reform  now senators mccain and feingold representatives shays and meehan have reached across party lines here to craft tough and fair reform their proposal would curb spending reduce the role of special interests create a level playing field between challengers and incumbents and ban contributions from noncitizens all corporate sources and the other large softmoney contributions that both parties receive  you know and i know that this can be delayed and you know and i know that delay will mean the death of reform  so lets set our own deadline lets work together to write bipartisan campaign finance reform into law and pass mccainfeingold by the day we celebrate the birth of our democracy july the 4th  there is a third piece of unfinished business over the last four years we moved a record two and a quarter million people off the welfare roles then last year congress enacted landmark welfare reform legislation demanding that all ablebodied recipients assume the responsibility of moving from welfare to work now each and every one of us has to fulfill our responsibility indeed our moral obligation to make sure that people who now must work can work and now we must act to meet a new goal two million more people off the welfare rolls by the year 2000  here is my plan tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire people off welfare incentives for job placement firms in states to create more jobs for welfare recipients training transportation and child care to help people go to work now i challenge every stateturn those welfare checks into private sector paychecks i challenge every religious congregation every community nonprofit every business to hire someone off welfare and id like to say especially to every employer in our country who ever criticized the old welfare system you cant blame that old system anymore we have torn it down now do your part give someone on welfare the chance to go to work  tonight i am pleased to announce that five major corporationssprint monsanto ups burger king and united airlineswill be the first to join in a new national effort to marshal americas businesses large and small to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work  we passed welfare reform all of you know i believe we were right to do it but no one can walk out of this chamber with a clear conscience unless you are prepared to finish the job  and we must join together to do something else too something both republican and democratic governors have asked us to do to restore basic health and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants who came to this country legally who work hard pay taxes and obey the law to do otherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrants  now looking ahead the greatest step of all the high threshold to the future we must now cross and my number one priority for the next four years is to ensure that all americans have the best education in the world thank you  lets work together to meet these three goals every eightyearold must be able to read every 12yearold must be able to log on to the internet every 18yearold must be able to go to college and every adult american must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime  my balanced budget makes an unprecedented commitment to these goals51 billion next yearbut far more than money is required i have a plan a call to action for american education based on these 10 principles  first a national crusade for education standardsnot federal government standards but national standards representing what all our students must know to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st century every state and school must shape the curriculum to reflect these standards and train teachers to lift students up to them to help schools meet the standards and measure their progress we will lead an effort over the next two years to develop national tests of student achievement in reading and math  tonight i issue a challenge to the nation every state should adopt high national standards and by 1999 every state should test every 4th grader in reading and every 8th grader in math to make sure these standards are met  raising standards will not be easy and some of our children will not be able to meet them at first the point is not to put our children down but to lift them up good tests will show us who needs help what changes in teaching to make and which schools need to improve they can help us end social promotion for no child should move from grade school to junior high or junior high to high school until he or she is ready  last month our secretary of education dick riley and i visited northern illinois where 8th grade students from 20 school districts in a project aptly called first in the world took the third international math and science study  thats a test that reflects the worldclass standards our children must meet for the new era and those students in illinois tied for first in the world in science and came in second in math two of them kristen tanner and chris getsla are here tonight along with their teacher sue winski theyre up there with the first lady and they prove that when we aim high and challenge our students they will be the best in the world lets give them a hand stand up please  second to have the best schools we must have the best teachers most of us in this chamber would not be here tonight without the help of those teachers i know that i wouldnt be here  for years many of our educators led by north carolinas governor jim hunt and the national board for professional teaching standards have worked very hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for excellence in teaching  just 500 of these teachers have been certified since 1995 my budget will enable 100000 more to seek national certification as master teachers we should reward and recognize our best teachers and as we reward them we should quickly and fairly remove those few who dont measure up and we should challenge more of our finest young people to consider teaching as a career  third we must do more to help all our children read forty percent40 percentof our 8yearolds cannot read on their own thats why we have just launched the america reads initiative to build a citizen army of one million volunteer tutors to make sure every child can read independently by the end of the 3rd grade we will use thousands of americorps volunteers to mobilize this citizen army we want at least 100000 college students to help  and tonight im pleased that 60 college presidents have answered my call pledging that thousands of their workstudy students will serve for one year as reading tutors  this is also a challenge to every teacher and every principal  you must use these tutors to help your students read and it is especially a challenge to our parents you must read with your children every night  this leads to the fourth principle learning begins in the first days of life scientists are now discovering how young children develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first days and how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking singing even reading to their infants the first lady has spent years writing about this issue studying it and she and i are going to convene a white house conference on early learning and the brain this spring to explore how parents and educators can best use these startling new findings  we already know we should start teaching children before they start school thats why this balanced budget expands head start to one million children by 2002 and that is why the vice president and mrs gore will host their annual family conference this june on what we can do to make sure that parents are an active part of their childrens learning all the way through school  theyve done a great deal to highlight the importance of family in our life and now theyre turning their attention to getting more parents involved in their childrens learning all the way through school i thank you mr vice president and i thank you especially tipper for what youre doing  fifth every state should give parents the power to choose the right public school for their children their right to choose will foster competition and innovation that can make public schools better we should also make it possible for more parents and teachers to start charter schools schools that set and meet the highest standards and exist only as long as they do  our plan will help america to create 3000 of these charter schools by the next century nearly seven times as there are in the country today so that parents will have even more choices in sending their children to the best schools  sixth character education must be taught in our schools we must teach our children to be good citizens and we must continue to promote order and discipline supporting communities that introduce school uniforms impose curfews enforce truancy laws remove disruptive students from the classroom and have zero tolerance for guns and drugs in schools  seventh we cannot expect our children to raise themselves up in schools that are literally falling down with the student population at an alltime high and record numbers of school buildings falling into disrepair this has now become a serious national concern therefore my budget includes a new initiative 5 billion to help communities finance 20 billion in school construction over the next four years  eighth we must make the 13th and 14th years of educationat least two years of collegejust as universal in america by the 21st century as a high school education is today and we must open the doors of college to all americans  to do that i propose americas hope scholarship based on georgias pioneering programtwo years of a 1500 tax credit for college tuition enough to pay for the typical community college i also propose a tax deduction of up to 10000 a year for all tuition after high school an expanded ira you can withdraw from tax free for education and the largest increase in pell grant scholarship in 20 years  now this plan will give most families the ability to pay no taxes on money they save for college tuition i ask you to pass it and give every american who works hard the chance to go to college  ninth in the 21st century we must expand the frontiers of learning across a lifetime all our people of whatever age must have the chance to learn new skills  most americans live near a community college the roads that take them there can be paths to a better future my gi bill for americas workers will transform the confusing tangle of federal training programs into a simple skill grant to go directly into eligible workers hands  for too long this bill has been sitting on that desk there without action i ask you to pass it now lets give more of our workers the ability to learn and to earn for a lifetime  tenth we must bring the power of the information age into all our schools  last year i challenged america to connect every classroom and library to the internet by the year 2000 so that for the first time in our history children in the most isolated rural town the most comfortable suburbs the poorest innercity schools will have the same access to the same universe of knowledge  that is my plana call to action for american education some may say that it is unusual for a president to pay this kind of attention to education some may say it is simply because the president and his wonderful wife have been obsessed with this subject for more years than they can recall that is not what is driving these proposals we must understand the significance of this endeavor  one of the greatest sources of our strength throughout the cold war was a bipartisan foreign policy because our future was at stake politics stopped at the waters edge now i ask you and i ask all our nations governors i ask parents teachers and citizens all across america for a new nonpartisan commitment to education because education is a critical national security issue for our future and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door  to prepare america for the 21st century we must harness the powerful forces of science and technology to benefit all americans this is the first state of the union carried live in video over the internet but weve only begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that should become the modern birthright of every citizen  our effort to connect every classroom is just the beginning now we should connect every hospital to the internet so that doctors can instantly share data about their patients with the best specialists in the field  and i challenge the private sector tonight to start by connecting every childrens hospital as soon as possible so that a child in bed can stay in touch with school family and friends a sick child need no longer be a child alone  we must build the second generation of the internet so that our leading universities and national laboratories can communicate in speeds a thousand times faster than today to develop new medical treatments new sources of energy new ways of working together but we cannot stop there  as the internet becomes our new town square a computer in every home a teacher of all subjects a connection to all cultures this will no longer be a dream but a necessity and over the next decade that must be our goal  we must continue to explore the heavens pressing on with the mars probes and the international space station both of which will have practical applications for our everyday living  we must speed the remarkable advances in medical science the human genome project is now decoding the genetic mysteries of life american scientists have discovered genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian cancer and medication that stops a stroke in progress and begins to reverse its effects and treatments that dramatically lengthen the lives of people with hiv and aids  since i took office funding for aids research at the national institutes of health has increased dramatically to 15 billion with new resources nih will now become the most powerful discovery engine for an aids vaccine working with other scientists to finally end the threat of aids thank you remember that every year every year we move up the discovery of an aids vaccine well save millions of lives around the world we must reinforce our commitment to medical science  to prepare america for the 21st century we must build stronger families over the past four years the family and medical leave law has helped millions of americans to take time off to be with their families  with new pressures on people and the way they work and live i believe we must expand family leave so that workers can take time off for teacher conferences and a childs medical checkup we should pass flex time so workers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it in for time off to be with their families  we must continuewe must continue step by step to give more families access to affordable quality health care forty million americans still lack health insurance ten million children still lack health insurance eighty percent of them have working parents who pay taxes that is wrong  mymy balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to 5 million of those children since nearly half of all children who lose their insurance do so because their parents lose or change a job my budget will also ensure that people who temporarily lose their jobs can still afford to keep their health insurance no child should be without a doctor just because a parent is without a job  my medicare plan modernizes medicare increases the life of the trust fund to 10 years provides support for respite care for the many families with loved ones afflicted with alzheimers and for the first time it would fully pay for annual mammograms  just as we ended drivethrough deliveries of babies last year we must now end the dangerous and demeaning practice of forcing women home from the hospital only hours after a mastectomy  i ask your support for bipartisan legislation to guarantee that a woman can stay in the hospital for 48 hours after a mastectomy with us tonight is dr kristen zarfos a connecticut surgeon whose outrage at this practice spurred a national movement and inspired this legislation id like her to stand so we can thank her for her efforts dr zarfos thank you  in the last four years we have increased child support collections by 50 percent now we should go further and do better by making it a felony for any parent to cross a state line in an attempt to flee from this his or her most sacred obligation  finally we must also protect our children by standing firm in our determination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that endanger their lives  to prepare america for the 21st century we must build stronger communities we should start with safe streets serious crime has dropped five years in a row the key has been community policing we must finish the job of putting 100000 community police on the streets of the united states  we should pass the victims rights amendment to the constitution and i ask you to mount a fullscale assault on juvenile crime with legislation that declares war on gangs with new prosecutors and tougher penalties extends the brady bill so violent teen criminals will not be able to buy handguns requires child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use and helps to keep our schools open after hours on weekends and in the summer so our young people will have someplace to go and something to say yes to  this balanced budget includes the largest antidrug effort everto stop drugs at their source punish those who push them and teach our young people that drugs are wrong drugs are illegal and drugs will kill them i hope you will support it  our growing economy has helped to revive poor urban and rural neighborhoods but we must do more to empower them to create the conditions in which all families can flourish and to create jobs through investment by business and loans by banks  we should double the number of empowerment zones theyve already brought so much hope to communities like detroit where the unemployment rate has been cut in half in four years we should restore contaminated urban land and buildings to constructive use we should expand the network of community development banks  and together we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment approach including private sector tax incentives to renew our capital city so that washington is a great place to work and liveand once again the proud face america shows the world  we must protect our environment in every community in the last four years we cleaned up 250 toxic waste sites as many as in the previous 12 now we should clean up 500 more so that our children grow up next to parks not poison i urge to pass my proposal to make big polluters live by a simple rule if you pollute our environment you should pay to clean it up  in the last four years we strengthened our nations safe food and clean drinking water laws we protected some of americas rarest most beautiful land in utahs red rocks region created three new national parks in the california desert and began to restore the florida everglades  now we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with our lands tonight i announce that this year i will designate 10 american heritage rivers to help communities alongside them revitalize their waterfronts and clean up pollution in the rivers proving once again that we can grow the economy as we protect the environment  we must also protect our global environment working to ban the worst toxic chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even as they change our climate  now we all know that in all of our communities some of our children simply dont have what they need to grow and learn in their own homes or schools or neighborhoods and that means the rest of us must do more for they are our children too thats why president bush general colin powell former housing secretary henry cisneros will join the vice president and me to lead the presidents summit of service in philadelphia in april  our national service program americorps has already helped 70000 young people to work their way through college as they serve america now we intend to mobilize millions of americans to serve in thousands of ways citizen service is an american responsibility which all americans should embrace and i ask your support for that endeavor  id like to make just one last point about our national community our economy is measured in numbers and statistics and its very important but the enduring worth of our nation lies in our shared values and our soaring spirit so instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to support the arts and humanities i believe we should stand by them and challenge our artists musicians and writers challenge our museums libraries and theaters  we should challenge all americans in the arts and humanities to join with their fellow citizens to make the year 2000 a national celebration of the american spirit in every community a celebration of our common culture in the century that is past and in the new one to come in a new millennium so that we can remain the worlds beacon not only of liberty but of creativity long after the fireworks have faded  to prepare america for the 21st century we must master the forces of change in the world and keep american leadership strong and sure for an uncharted time  fifty years ago a farsighted america led in creating the institutions that secured victory in the cold war and built a growing world economy as a result today more people than ever embrace our ideals and share our interests already we have dismantled many of the blocks and barriers that divided our parents world for the first time more people live under democracy than dictatorship including every nation in our own hemisphere but one and its day too will come  now we stand at another moment of change and choice and another time to be farsighted to bring america 50 more years of security and prosperity  in this endeavor our first task is to help to build for the very first time an undivided democratic europe when europe is stable prosperous and at peace america is more secure  to that end we must expand nato by 1999 so that countries that were once our adversaries can become our allies at the special nato summit this summer that is what we will begin to do we must strengthen natos partnership for peace with nonmember allies and we must build a stable partnership between nato and a democratic russia  an expanded nato is good for america and a europe in which all democracies define their future not in terms of what they can do to each other but in terms of what they can do together for the good of allthat kind of europe is good for america  second america must look to the east no less than to the west  our security demands it americans fought three wars in asia in this century  our prosperity requires it more than 2 million american jobs depend upon trade with asia there too we are helping to shape an asia pacific community of cooperation not conflict  let ourlet our progress there not mask the peril that remains together with south korea we must advance peace talks with north korea and bridge the cold wars last divide and i call on congress to fund our share of the agreement under which north korea must continue to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear weapons program  we must pursue a deeper dialogue with china for the sake of our interests and our ideals an isolated china is not good for america a china playing its proper role in the world is i will go to china and i have invited chinas president to come here not because we agree on everything but because engaging china is the best way to work on our common challenges like ending nuclear testing and to deal frankly with our fundamental differences like human rights  the american people must prosper in the global economy weve worked hard to tear down trade barriers abroad so that we can create good jobs at home im proud to say that today america is once again the most competitive nation and the no 1 exporter in the world  now we must act to expand our exports especially to asia and latin america two of the fastestgrowing regions on earth or be left behind as these emerging economies forge new ties with other nations that is why we need the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open markets to our goods and services even as we preserve our values  we need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy after all we have the best workers and the best products in a truly open market we can outcompete anyone anywhere on earth  but this is about more than economics by expanding trade we can advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world there is no better example of this truth than latin america where democracy and open markets are on the march together that is why i will visit there in the spring to reinforce our important ties  we should all be proud that america led the effort to rescue our neighbor mexico from its economic crisis and we should all be proud that last month mexico repaid the united states three full years ahead of schedule with half a billion dollar profit to us  america must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace from the middle east to haiti from northern ireland to africa taking reasonable risks for peace keeps us from being drawn into far more costly conflicts later with american leadership the killing has stopped in bosnia now the habits of peace must take hold  the new nato force will allow reconstruction and reconciliation to accelerate tonight i ask congress to continue its strong support of our troops they are doing a remarkable job there for america and america must do right by them  fifth we must move strongly against new threats to our security in the past four years we agreed to banwe led the way to a worldwide agreement to ban nuclear testing  with russia we dramatically cut nuclear arsenals and we stopped targeting each others citizens we are acting to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and to rid the world of land mines  we are working with other nations with renewed intensity to fight drug traffickers and to stop terrorists before they act and hold them fully accountable if they do  now we must rise to a new test of leadershipratifying the chemical weapons convention make no mistake about it it will make our troops safer from chemical attack it will help us to fight terrorism we have no more important obligations especially in the wake of what we now know about the gulf war  this treaty has been bipartisan from the beginning supported by republican and democratic administrations and republican and democratic members of congress and already approved by 68 nations but if we do not act by april the 29th when this convention goes into forcewith or without uswe will lose the chance to have americans leading and enforcing this effort together we must make the chemical weapons convention law so that at last we can begin to outlaw poisoned gas from the earth  finally we must have the tools to meet all these challenges we must maintain a strong and ready military we must increase funding for weapons modernization by the year 2000 and we must take good care of our men and women in uniform they are the worlds finest  we must also renew our commitment to americas diplomacy and pay our debts and dues to international financial institutions like the world bankand to a reforming united nations every dollarevery dollar we devote to preventing conflicts to promoting democracy to stopping the spread of disease and starvation brings a sure return in security and savings yet international affairs spending today is just 1 percent of the federal budget a small fraction of what america invested in diplomacy to choose leadership over escapism at the start of the cold war  if america is to continue to lead the world we here who lead america simply must find the will to pay our way a farsighted america moved the world to a better place over these last 50 years and so it can be for another 50 years but a shortsighted america will soon find its words falling on deaf ears all around the world  almost exactly 50 years ago in the first winter of the cold war president truman stood before a republican congress and called upon our country to meet its responsibilities of leadership this was his warning he said if we falter we may endanger the peace of the world and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation  that congress led by republicans like senator arthur vandenburg answered president trumans call together they made the commitments that strengthened our country for 50 years now let us do the same let us do what it takes to remain the indispensable nation to keep america strong secure and prosperous for another 50 years  in the end more than anything else our world leadership grows out of the power of our example here at home out of our ability to remain strong as one america  all over the world people are being torn asunder by racial ethnic and religious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror we are the worlds most diverse democracy and the world looks to us to show that it is possible to live and advance together across those kinds of differences america has always been a nation of immigrants  from the start a steady stream of people in search of freedom and opportunity have left their own lands to make this land their home we started as an experiment in democracy fueled by europeans we have grown into an experiment in democratic diversity fueled by openness and promise  my fellow americans we must never ever believe that our diversity is a weakness it is our greatest strength  americans speak every language know every country people on every continent can look to us and see the reflection of their own great potential and they always will as long as we strive to give all our citizens whatever their background an opportunity to achieve their own greatness  were not there yet we still see evidence of a biting bigotry and intolerance in ugly words and awful violence in burned churches and bombed buildings we must fight against this in our country and in our hearts  just a few days before my second inauguration one of our countrys bestknown pastors reverend robert schuller suggested that i read isaiah 5812 heres what it says thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in  i placed my hand on that verse when i took the oath of office on behalf of all americans for no matter what our differences in our faiths our backgrounds our politics we must all be repairers of the breach  i want to say a word about two other americans who show us how congressman frank tejeda was buried yesterday a proud american whose family came from mexico he was only 51 years old he was awarded the silver star the bronze star and the purple heart fighting for his country in vietnam and he went on to serve texas and america fighting for our future here in this chamber  we are grateful for his service and honored that his mother lillie tejeda and his sister mary alice have come from texas to be with us here tonight and we welcome you thank you  gary locke the newlyelected governor of washington state is the first chineseamerican governor in the history of our country hes the proud son of two of the millions of asian american immigrants who strengthened america with their hard work family values and good citizenship  he represents the future we can all achieve thank you governor for being here please stand up  reverend schuller congressman tejeda governor locke along with kristen tanner and chris getsla sue winski and dr kristen zarfostheyre all americans from different roots whose lives reflect the best of what we can become when we are one america  we may not share a common past but we surely do share a common future building one america is our most important mission the foundation for many generations of every other strength we must build for this new century money cannot buy it power cannot compel it technology cannot create it it can only come from the human spirit  america is far more than a place it is an ideathe most powerful idea in the history of nations and all of us in this chamber we are now the bearers of that idea leading a great people into a new world  a child born tonight will have almost no memory of the 20th century everything that child will know about america will be because of what we do now to build a new century we dont have a moment to waste  tomorrow there will be just over 1000 days until the year 2000 one thousand days to prepare our people one thousand days to work together one thousand days to build a bridge to a land of new promise  my fellow americans we have work to do let us seize those days and the century  thank you god bless you and god bless america  
204, State of the Union Address, William J. Clinton,1998-01-27,  mr speaker mr vice president members of the 105th congress distinguished guests my fellow americans  since the last time we met in this chamber america has lost two patriots and fine public servants though they sat on opposite sides of the aisle representatives walter capps and sonny bono shared a deep love for this house and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people  in the past few weeks they have both been eulogized tonight i think we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that we celebrate their lives and give thanks for their service to our nation  for 209 years it has been the presidents duty to report to you on the state of the union because of the hard work and high purpose of the american people these are good times for america we have more than 14 million new jobs the lowest unemployment in 24 years the lowest core inflation in 30 years incomes are rising and we have the highest home ownership in history crime has dropped for a record five years in a row and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years our leadership in the world is unrivaled ladies and gentlemen the state of our union is strong  but with barely 700 days left in the 20th century this is not a time to rest it is a time to buildto build the america within reach an america where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work where every citizen can live in a safe community where families are strong schools are good and all our young people can go on to college an america where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to alzheimers to aids an america where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written every painting ever painted every symphony ever composed where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities an america which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity  this is the america we have begun to build this is the america we can leave to our childrenif we join together to finish the work at hand let us strengthen our nation for the 21st century  rarely have americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so short a time quietly but with gathering force the ground has shifted beneath our feet as we have moved into an information age a global economy a truly new world  for five years now we have met the challenge of these changes as americans have at every turning point in our history by renewing the very idea of america widening the circle of opportunity deepening the meaning of our freedom forging a more perfect union we shaped a new kind of government for the information age i thank the vice president for his leadership and the congress for its support in building a government that is leaner more flexible a catalyst for new ideas and most of all a government that gives the american people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives  we have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer my fellow americans we have found a third way we have the smallest government in 35 years but a more progressive one we have a smaller government but a stronger nation  we are moving steadily toward a an even stronger america in the 21st centuryan economy that offers opportunity a society rooted in responsibility and a nation that lives as a community  first americans in this chamber and across this nation have pursued a new strategy for prosperity fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth investments in education and skills in science and technology and transportation to prepare our people for the new economy new markets for american products and american workers  when i took office the deficit for 1998 was projected to be 357 billion and heading higher this year our deficit is projected to be 10 billion and heading lower  for three decades six presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our nation tonight i come before you to announce that the federal deficit once so incomprehensively large that it had 11 zeros will be simply zero  i will submit to congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years  and if we hold fast to fiscal discipline we may balance the budget this yearfour years ahead of schedule  you can all be proud of that because turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle it is the product of hard work by the american people and of two visionary actions in congress the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent and the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this congress  heres the really good news if we maintain our resolve we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see  we must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit last year together we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years  my plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families for education for child care for the environment  but whether the issue is tax cuts or spending i ask all of you to meet this test approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit  now if we balance the budget for next year it is projected that well then have a sizeable surplus in the years that immediately follow what should we do with this projected surplus  i have a simple fourword answer save social security first  tonight i propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplusthats every penny of any surplusuntil we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the social security system for the 21st century  let us saylet us say to all americans watching tonight whether youre 70 or 50 or whether you just started paying into the system social security will be there when you need it let us make this commitment social security first lets do thattogether  i also want to say that all the american people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion in facing these issues squarely and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed well start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country and i hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate well hold a white house conference on social security in december and one year from now i will convene the leaders of congress to craft historic bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation a social security system that is strong in the 21st century  in an economy that honors opportunity all americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity because these times are good we can afford to take one simple sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families we should raise the minimum wage  the information age is first and foremost an education age in which education will start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime last year from this podium i said that education has to be our highest priority i laid out a 10point plan to move us forward and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door  since then this congressacross party linesand the american people have responded in the most important year for education in a generation expanding public school choice opening the way to 3000 charter schools working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway committing to expand head start to a million children launching america reads sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8yearolds can read  last year i proposedand you passed220000 new pell grant scholarships for deserving students student loans already less expensive and easier to repaynow you get to deduct the interest families all over america now can put their savings into new taxfree education iras  and this year for the first two years of college families will get a 1500 tax credita hope scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition and for junior and senior year graduate school and job training there is a lifetime learning credit you did that and you should be very proud of it  and because of these actions i have something to say to every family listening to us tonight your children can go on to college if you know a child from a poor family tell her not to give up she can go on to college if you know a young couple struggling with bills worried they wont be able to send their children to college tell them not to give up their children can go on to college if you know somebody whos caught in a deadend job and afraid he cant afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life tell him not to give up he can go on to college  because of the things that have been done we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today and my friends that will change the face and future of america  we have opened wide the doors of the worlds best system of higher education now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the worlds best as wellby raising standards raising expectations and raising accountability  thanks to the actions of this congress last year we will soon have for the very first time a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math  parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics and every parent already knows the key good teachers and small classes  tonight i propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades my balanced budget will help to hire a hundred thousand new teachers who have passed the state competency tests now with these teacherslistenwith these teachers we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first second and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across america  now if ive got the math right more teachers teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms so i also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5000 schools  we must also demand greater accountability when we promote a child from grade to grade who hasnt mastered the work we dont do that child any favors it is time to end social promotion in americas schools  last year in chicago they made that decisionnot to hold our children back but to lift them up chicago stopped social promotion and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up  i propose to help other communities follow chicagos lead lets say to them stop promoting children who dont learn and we will give you the tools to make sure they do  i also ask this congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children starting in the sixth grade so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they too will be able to go on to college  as we enter the 21st century the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the markets of the world we must shape this global economy not shrink from it  in the last five years we have led the way in opening new markets with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp made in the usa today record high exports account for fully onethird of our economic growth i want to keep them going because thats the way to keep america growing and to advance a safer more stable world  now all of you know whatever your views are that i think this is a great opportunity for america i know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements i have listened carefully and i believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears first that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors even if theres more business and second that if we have more trade more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over  i think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world it shouldi have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda but we cannot influence other countries decisions if we send them a message that were backing away from trade with them  this year i will send legislation to congress and ask other nations to join us to fight the most intolerable labor practice of allabusive child labor  we should also offer help and hope to those americans temporarily left behind with the global marketplace or by the march of technology which may have nothing to do with trade thats why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993 and if my new budget is adopted we will triple funding thats why we must do more and more quickly to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason  you know we help communities in a special way when their military base closes we ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes again i ask the congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single gi bill for workers a simple skills grant so people can on their own move quickly to new jobs to higher incomes and brighter futures  now we all know in every way in life change is not always easy but we have to decide whether were going to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefits and remember the big picture here while weve been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements weve been creating millions of new jobs so this year we will forge new partnerships with latin america asia and europe and we should pass the new african trade act it has bipartisan support  i will also renew my request for the fasttrack negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets created more new jobs which every president has had for two decades  you know whether we like it or not in ways that are mostly positive the worlds economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent today an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere recent months have brought serious financial problems to thailand indonesia south korea and beyond  now why should americans be concerned about this  first these countries are our customers if they sink into recession they wont be able to buy the goods wed like to sell them  second theyre also our competitors so if their currencies lose their value and go down then the price of their goods will drop flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods which makes it a lot tougher for our people to compete  and finally they are our strategic partners their stability bolsters our security  the american economy remains sound and strong and i want to keep it that way but because the turmoil in asia will have an impact on all the worlds economies including ours making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for america and the right thing to do for a safer world  our policy is clear no nation can recover if it does not reform itself but when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform we should help them do it so i call on congress to renew americas commitment to the international monetary fund  and i think we should say to all the people were trying to represent here that preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder til the clouds are just overhead  a strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility a society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work not welfare we could be proud that after decades of fingerpointing and failure together we ended the old welfare system and were now replacing welfare checks with paychecks  last year after a record fouryear decline in welfare rolls i challenged our nation to move two million more americans off welfare by the year 2000 im pleased to report we have also met that goal two full years ahead of schedule  this is a grand achievement the sum of many acts of individual courage persistence and hope  for 13 years elaine kinslow of indianapolis indiana was on and off welfare today shes a dispatcher with a van company shes saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood and shes helping other welfare recipients go to work  elaine kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution there are millions like her all across america and i am happy she could join the first lady tonight elaine were very proud of you please stand up  we still have a lot more to do all of us to make welfare reform a success providing child care helping families move closer to available jobs challenging more companies to join our welfare to work partnership increasing childsupport collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children i also want to thank congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard and i hope you will finish that job this year  we have to make it possible for all hardworking families to meet their most important responsibilities two years ago we helped guarantee that americans can keep their health insurance when they changed jobs last year we extended health care to up to 5 million children this year i challenge congress to take the next historic steps a hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans these plans save money and they can improve care but medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors not insurance company accountants  i urge this congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this you have the right to know all your medical options not just the cheapest you have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need you have the right to emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it you have the right to keep your medical records confidential  now traditional care or managed care every american deserves quality care millions of americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance some are retired some are laid off some lose their coverage when their spouses retire after a lifetime of work theyre left with nowhere to turn  so i ask the congress let these hardworking americans buy into the medicare system it wont add a dime to the deficit but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless  next we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face an epidemic of teen smoking spread by multimillion dollar marketing campaigns i challenge congress lets pass bipartisan comprehensive legislation that will improve public health protect our tobacco farmers and change the way tobacco companies do business forever  lets do what it takes to bring teen smoking down lets raise the price of cigarettes by up to 150 a pack over the next 10 years with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children  now tomorrow like every day 3000 children will start smoking and a thousand will die early as a result let this congress be remembered as the congress that saved their lives  in the new economy most parents work harder than ever they face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents  the family and medical leave act was the very first bill i was privileged to sign into law as president in 1993 since then about 15 million people have taken advantage of it and ive met a lot of them all across this country i ask you to extend the law to cover 10 million more workers and to give parents time off when they have to go see their childrens teachers or take them to the doctor  child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work last year i cohosted the very first white house conference on child care with one of our foremost experts americas first lady from all corners of america we heard the same messagewithout regard to region or income or political affiliationweve got to raise the quality of child care weve got to make it safer weve got to make it more affordable  so heres my plan help families to pay for child care for a million more children scholarships and background checks for childcare workers and a new emphasis on early learning tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees and a larger childcare tax credit for working families  now if you pass my plan what this means is that a family of four with an income of 35000 and high childcare costs will no longer pay a single penny of federal income tax  you know i think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience i have often wondered how my mother when she was a young widow would have been able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support me if my grandparents hadnt been able to take care of me she and i were really very lucky  how many other families have never had that same opportunity the truth is we dont know the answer to that question but we do know what the answer should be not a single american family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love  a society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets safe schools and safe neighborhoods we pursued a strategy of more police tougher punishment smarter prevention with crimefighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups where the rubber hits the road  i can report to you tonight that its working violent crime is down robbery is down assault is down burglary is down for five years in a row all across america now we need to finish the job of putting 100000 more police on our streets  again i ask congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life and i ask you to dramatically expand our support for afterschool programs i think every american should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 300 in the afternoon and 800 at night we can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them some place to go other than the streets and we ought to do it  drug use is on the decline i thank general mccaffrey for his leadership and i thank this congress for passing the largest antidrug budget in history now i ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire a thousand new border patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders  police prosecutors and prevention programs good as they are they cant work if our court system doesnt work today there are large numbers of vacancies in our federal courts here is what the chief justice of the united states wrote judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice  i simply ask the united states senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified nominees before you up or down  we must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world on the eve of a new century we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security but make no mistake about it todays possibilities are not tomorrows guarantees america must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism we must combat an unholy access of new threats from terrorists international criminals and drug traffickers  these 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people and they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands to meet these challenges we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not  within days i will ask the senate for its advice and consent to make hungary poland and the czech republic the newest members of nato for 50 years nato contained communism and kept america and europe secure now these three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy i ask the senate to say yes to them our new allies  by taking in new members and working closely with new partners including russia and ukraine nato can help to assure that europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century  next i will ask congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in bosnia this christmas hillary and i traveled to sarajevo with senator and mrs dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation we saw children playing in the streets where two years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells the shops were filled with food the cafes were alive with conversation the progress there is unmistakable but it is not yet irreversible  to take firm root bosnias fragile peace still needs the support of american and allied troops when the current nato mission ends in june i think senator dole actually said it best he said this is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory  i wish all of you could have seen our troops in tuzla theyre very proud of what they are doing in bosnia and were all very proud of them one of thoseone of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight army sergeant michael tolbert his father was a decorated vietnam vet after college in colorado he joined the army last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in bosnia thank you very much sergeant for what you represent  in bosnia and around the world our men and women in uniform always do their mission well our mission must be to keep them welltrained and ready to improve their quality of life and to provide the 21st century weapons they need to defeat any enemy  i ask congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction this year four decades after it was first proposed by president eisenhower a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach by ending nuclear testing we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for nonnuclear states to build them  i am pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staffgenerals john shalikashvili colin powell and david jones and admiral william crowehave endorsed this treaty and i ask the senate to approve it this year  together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them  saddam hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nations wealth not on providing for the iraqi people but on developing nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them  the united nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job finding and destroying more of iraqs arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war now saddam hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission  i know i speak for everyone in this chamber republicans and democrats when i say to saddam hussein you cannot defy the will of the world and when i say to him you have used weapons of mass destruction before we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again  last year the senate ratified the chemical weapons convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas now we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror the biological weapons convention has been in effect for 23 years now the rules are good but the enforcement is weak we must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating in the months ahead i will pursue our security strategy with old allies in asia and europe and new partners from africa to india and pakistan from south america to china and from belfast to korea to the middle east america will continue to stand with those who stand for peace  finally its long past time to make good on our debt to the united nations  more and more we are working with other nations to achieve common goals if we want america to lead weve got to set a good example as we seeas we see so clearly in bosnia allies who share our goals can also share our burdens in this new era our freedom and independence are actually enriched not weakened by our increasing interdependence with other nations but we have to do our part  our founders set america on a permanent course toward a more perfect union to all of you i say it is a journey we can only make together living as one community  first we have to continue to reform our government the instrument of our national community everyone knows elections have become too expensive fueling a fundraising arms race  this year by march the 6th at long last the senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by senators mccain and feingold lets be clear a vote against mccainfeingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo i ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year  but at least equally important we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs the high cost of media advertising i will for the folks watching at home those were the groans of pain in the audiencei will formally request that the federal communications commission act to provide free or reducedcost television timefor candidates who observe spending limits voluntarily the airwaves are a public trust and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy  under the leadership of vice president gore we have reduced the federal payroll by 300000 workers cut 16000 pages of regulation eliminated hundreds of programs and improved the operations of virtually every government agency but we can do more  like every taxpayer im outraged by the reports of abuses by the irs we need some changes there new citizen advocacy panels a stronger taxpayer advocate phone lines open 24 hours a day relief for innocent taxpayers  last year by an overwhelming bipartisan margin the house of representatives passed sweeping irs reforms this bill must not now languish in the senate tonight i ask the senate follow the house pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business i hope to goodness before i finish i can think of something to say follow the senate on so ill be out of trouble  a nation that lives as a community must value all its communities for the past five years we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas with community development banks more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods cleanup of polluted sites for development  under the continued leadership of the vice president we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in those areas we should we should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own and we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more lowincome housing  last year this congress took strong action to help the district of columbia let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city for all who live and visit here  our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas they are still the gateway for new immigrants from every continent who come here to work for their own american dreams lets keep our cities going strong into the 21st century theyre a very important part of our future  our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe the water they drink the earth they will inherit last year we put in place the toughestever controls on smog and soot we moved to protect yellowstone the everglades lake tahoe we expanded every communitys right to know about toxics that threaten their children  just yesterday our food safety plan took effect using new science to protect consumers from dangers like e coli and salmonella  tonight i ask you to join me in launching a new clean water initiative a farreaching effort to clean our rivers our lakes and our coastal waters for our children  our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change global warming the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action the vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we dont reduce the emission of greenhouse gases at some point in the next century well disrupt our climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk  this past december america led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces new technologies energy efficiency  we have it in our power to act right here right now i propose 6 billion in tax cuts in research and development to encourage innovation renewable energy fuelefficient cars energyefficient homes every time we have acted to heal our environment pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy well today our economy is the strongest in a generation and our environment is the cleanest in a generation we have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time and when it comes to global warming well do it again  finally community means living by the defining american value the ideal heard round the world that were all created equal throughout our history we havent always honored that ideal and weve never fully lived up to it often its easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common it may be easier but its wrong  what we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that america truly becomes one nation what do we have to do were becoming more and more and more diverse do you believe we can become one nation the answer cannot be to dwell on our differences but to build on our shared values  and we all cherish family and faith freedom and responsibility we all want our children to grow up in the world where their talents are matched by their opportunities  ive launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one america let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome  discrimination against any american is unamerican we must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal i ask your help to end the backlog at the equal employment opportunity commission sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice and we should act now to end their wait  we should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one america lies in the progress we make for all americans without regard to race when we open the doors of college to all americans when we rid all our streets of crime when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods when we make sure all parents have the child care they need were helping to build one nation  we in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address the continuing american challenge to build one america but well only move forward if all our fellow citizens including every one of you at home watching tonight is also committed to this cause  we must work together learn together live together serve together on the forge of common enterprise americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity  we see it today in the united states military in the peace corps in americorps wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance we do just fine with shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communications and citizen service we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect we are many we must be one  in that spirit let us lift our eyes to the new millennium how will we mark that passage it just happens once every thousand years this year hillary and i launched the white house millennium program to promote americas creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century our culture lives in every community and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as americans we should protect them  i am proposing a publicprivate partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving americas treasures great and small and while we honor the past let us imagine the future  now think about this the entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years in the 1980s scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis it took nine years last year scientists located the gene that causes parkinsons diseasein only nine days within a decade gene chips will offer a road map for prevention of illnesses throughout a lifetime soon well be able to carry all the phone calls on mothers day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair a child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22nd century  tonight as part of our gift to the millennium i propose a 21st century research fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry the largest funding increase in history for the national institutes of health the national science foundation and the national cancer institute we have already discovered we have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes i ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases  as important as all this scientific progress is we must continue to see that science serves humanity not the other way around we must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any american and we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities and ban the cloning of human beings  we should enable all the worlds people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace think of this the first time i made a state of the union speech to you only a handful of physicists used the world wide web literally just a handful of people  now in schools and libraries homes and businesses millions and millions of americans surf the net every day  we must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the net but we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the internet we can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids for one thing i ask congress to step up support for building the next generation internet its getting kind of clogged you know and the next generation internet will operate at speeds up to a thousand times faster than today  even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium were going to open new frontiers in outer space  throughout all history human kind has had only one place to call home our planet earth beginning this year 1998 men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavensthe international space station with its vast expanses scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential  and this october a true american hero a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one fivehour space flight that changed the world will return to the heavens godspeed john glenn  john you will carry with you americas hopes and on your uniform once again you will carry americas flag marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of americas past and the daring of americas future  nearly 200 years ago a tattered flag its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle moved francis scott key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope the words that became our national anthem today that starspangled banner along with the declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights are on display just a short walk from here they are americas treasures and we must also save them for the ages  i ask all americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of america an america that has continued to rise through every age against every challenge a people of great works and greater possibilities who have always always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation to widen the circle of opportunity to deepen the meaning of our freedom to form that more perfect union  let that be our gift to the 21st century  god bless you and god bless the united states  
205, State of the Union Address, William J. Clinton,1999-01-19,  mr speaker mr vice president members of congress honored guests my fellow americans  tonight i have the honor of reporting to you on the state of the union  let me begin by saluting the new speaker of the house and thanking him especially tonight for extending an invitation to two guests sitting in the gallery with mrs hastert lyn gibson and wei ling chestnut are the widows of the two brave capitol hill police officers who gave their lives to defend freedoms house  mr speaker at your swearing in you asked us all to work together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship mr speaker lets do exactly that  tonight i stand before you to report that america has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history with nearly 18 million new jobs wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation the highest homeownership in history the smallest welfare roles in 30 years and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957  for the first time in three decades the budget is balanced from a deficit of 290 billion in 1992 we had a surplus of 70 billion last year and now we are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years  thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you we have the lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a quarter century  america is a strong force for peacefrom northern ireland to bosnia to the middle east  thanks to the leadership of vice president gore we have a government for the information age once again a government that is a progressive instrument of the common good rooted in our oldest values of opportunity responsibility and community devoted to fiscal responsibility determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives in the 21st century a 21st century government for 21st century america  my fellow americans i stand before you tonight to report that the state of our union is strong now america is working again the promise of our future is limitless but we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency how we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation today  so with our budget surplus growing our economy expanding our confidence rising now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century  our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge the aging of america with the number of elderly americans set to double by 2030 the baby boom will become a senior boom  so first and above all we must save social security for the 21st century  early in this century being old meant being poor when president roosevelt created social security thousands wrote to thank him for eliminating what one woman called the stark terror of penniless helpless old age even today without social security half our nations elderly would be forced into poverty  today social security is strong but by 2013 payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments by 2032 the trust fund will be exhausted and social security will be unable to pay the full benefits older americans have been promised  the best way to keep social security a rock solid guarantee is not to make drastic cuts in benefits not to raise payroll tax rates not to drain resources from social security in the name of saving it instead i propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save social security  specifically i propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to social security investing a small portion in the private sector just as any private or state government pension would do this will earn a higher return and keep social security sound for 55 years  but we must aim higher we should put social security on a sound footing for the next 75 years we should reduce poverty among elderly women who are nearly twice as likely to be poor as are other seniors and we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on social security can earn  now these changes will require difficult but fully achievable choices over and above the dedication of the surplus they must be made on a bipartisan basis they should be made this year so let me say to you tonight i reach out my hand to all of you in both houses in both parties and ask that we join together in saying to the american people we will save social security now  now last year we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save social security again i say we shouldnt spend any of it not any of it until after social security is truly saved first things first  second once we have saved social security we must fulfill our obligation to save and improve medicare already we have extended the life of the medicare trust fund by 10 years but we should extend it for at least another decade tonight i propose that we use one out of every six dollars in the surplus for the next 15 years to guarantee the soundness of medicare until the year 2020  but againbut again we should aim higher we must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas including the upcoming report of the bipartisan medicare commission if we work together we can secure medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing need of seniorsaffordable prescription drugs  third we must help all americans from their first day on the job to save to invest to create wealth  from its beginnings americans have supplemented social security with private pensions and savings yet today millions of people retire with little to live on other than social security americans living longer than ever simply must save more than ever  therefore in addition to saving social security and medicare i propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century i propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish universal savings accountsusa accountsto give all americans the means to save  with these new accounts americans can invest as they choose and receive funds to match a portion of their savings with extra help for those least able to save usa accounts will help all americans to share in our nations wealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement i ask you to support them  fourth we must invest in longterm care  i propose a tax credit of 1000 for the aged ailing or disabled and the families who care for them longterm care will become a bigger and bigger challenge with the aging of americaand we must do more to help our families deal with it  i was born in 1946 the first year of the baby boom i can tell you that one of the greatest concerns of our generation is our absolute determination not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren  our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us the opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders and we should take it  saving social security medicare creating us accounts this is the right way to use the surplus if we do so if we do so we will still have resources to meet critical needs and education and defense  and i want to point out that this proposal is fiscally sound listen to this if we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for social security and 16 percent for medicare over the next 15 years that savings will achieve the lowest level of publiclyheld debt since right before world war i in 1917  so with these four measures saving social security strengthening medicare establishing the usa accounts supporting longterm care we can begin to meet our generations historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century seniors  now there are more children from more diverse backgrounds in our public schools that any time in our history their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire nation to thrive in the new economy  today we can say something we couldnt say six years ago with tax credits and more affordable student loans with more workstudy grants and more pell grants with education iras the new hope scholarship tax cut that more than five million americans will receive this year we have finally opened the doors of college to all americans  with our support nearly every state has set higher academic standards for public schools and a voluntary national test is being developed to measure the progress of our students with over 1 billion in discounts available this year we are well on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom and library to the internet  last fall you passed our proposal to start hiring 100000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades now i ask you to finish the job  you know our children are doing better sat scores are up math scores have risen in nearly all grades but theres a problem while our fourthgraders out performed their peers in other countries in math and science our eighthgraders are around average and our 12thgraders rank near the bottom we must do better  now each year the national government invests more than 15 billion in our public schools i believe we must change the way we invest that money to support what works and to stop supporting what does not work  first later this year i will send to congress a plan that for the first time holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results my education accountability act will require every school district receiving federal help to take the following five steps  first all schools must end social promotion  now no child no child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she cant read we do our children no favors when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without mastering the material but we cant just hold students back because the system fails them  so my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and afterschool programs to keep a million children learning now ifif you doubt this will work just look at chicago which ended social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who dont master the basics math and reading scores are up three years running with some of the biggest gains in some of the poorest neighborhoods it will work and we should do it  second all states and school districts must turn around their worst performing schools or shut them down thats the policy established in north carolina by governor jim hunt north carolina made the biggest gains in test scores in the nation last year our budget includes 200 million to help states turn around their own failing schools  third all states and school districts must be held responsible for the quality of their teachers the great majority of our teachers do a fine job but in too many schools teachers dont have college majors or even minors in the subjects they teach new teachers should be required to pass performance exams and all teachers should know the subject their teaching  this years balanced budget contains resources to help them reach higher standards and to attract talented young teachers to the toughest assignments i recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarships for students who commit to teach in the innercities and isolated rural areas and in indian communities let us bring excellence to every part of america  fourth we must empower parents with more information and more choices in too many communities its easier to get information on the quality of the local restaurants than on the quality of the local schools  every school district should issue report cards on every school and parents should be given more choices in selecting their public schools  when i became president there was just one independent public charter school in all america with our support on a bipartisan basis today there are 1100 my budget assures that early in the next century there will be 3000  fifth to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning and to respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years we should say that all states and school districts must both adopt and implement sensible discipline policies  now lets do one more thing for our children today too many schools are so old theyre falling apart or so overcrowded students are learning in trailers last fall congress missed the opportunity to change that this year with 53 million children in our schools congress must not miss that opportunity again i ask you to help our communities build or modernize 5000 schools  if we do these thingsend social promotion turn around failing schools build modern ones support qualified teachers promote innovation competition and disciplinethen we will begin to meet our generations historic responsibility to create to 21st century schools  now we also have to do more to support the millions of parents who give their all every day at home and at work  the most basic tool of all is a decent income so lets raise the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years  and lets make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal work by strengthening enforcement of the equal pay laws  that was encouraging you know there was more balance on the seesaw i like that lets give them a hand thats great  working parents also need quality child care so again this year i ask congress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working families for improved safety and quality for expanded afterschool program and our plan also includes a new tax credit for stayathome parents too they need support as well  parents should never have to worry about choosing between their children and their work now the family and medical leave act the very first bill i signed into law has now since 1993 helped millions and millions of americans to care for a newborn baby or an ailing relative without risking their jobs i think its time with all of the evidence that it has been so little burdensome to employers to extend family leave to 10 million more americans working for smaller companies and i hope you will support it  finally on the matter of work parents should never have to face discrimination in the workplace so i want to ask congress to prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have children that is not right  americas families deserve the worlds best medical care thanks to bipartisan federal support for medical research we are not on the verge of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases from parkinsons to alzheimers to arthritis to cancer but as we continue our advances in medical science we cant let our medical system lag behind  managed care has literally transformed medicine in america driving down costs but threatening to drive down quality as well  i think we ought to say to every american you should have the right to know all you medical options not just the cheapest if you need a specialist you should have a right to see one you have a right to the nearest emergency care if youre in an accident these are things that we ought to say and i think we ought to say you should have a right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment whether its a pregnancy or a chemotherapy treatment or anything else i believe this  now ive ordered these rights to be extended to the 85 million americans served by medicare medicaid and other federal health programs but only congress can pass a patients bill of rights for all americans  last year congress missed that opportunity and we must not miss that opportunity again for the sake of our families i ask us to join together across party lines and pass a strong enforceable patients bill of rights  as more of our medical records are stored electronically the threats to all of our privacy increase because congress has given me the authority to act if it does not do so by august one way or another we can all say to the american people we will protect the privacy of medical records this year  now two years ago we acted to extend health coverage to up to five million children now we should go beyond that we should make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance we should give people between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into medicare  and we should continue to ensure access to family planning no one should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job and therefore i especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the landmark bipartisan legislation proposed by sens kennedy and jeffords roth and moynihan to allow people with disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go to work  we need to enable our public hospitals our community our university health centers to provide basic affordable care for all the millions of working families who dont have any insurance they do a lot of that today but much more can be done and my balanced budget makes a good down payment toward that goal i hope you will think about them and support that provision  let me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental illness no american should ever be ableafraid ever to address this disease this year we will host a white house conference on mental health with sensitivity commitment and passion tipper gore is leading our efforts here and id like to thank her for what shes done thank you thank you  as everyone knows our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes now i ask this congress to resist the tobacco lobby to reaffirm the fdas authority to protect our children from tobacco and to hold tobacco companies accountable while protecting tobacco farmers  smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under medicare and other programs you know the states have been right about this taxpayers shouldnt pay for the cost of lung cancer emphysema and other smokingrelated illnesses the tobacco companies should  so tonight i announce that the justice department is preparing a litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court and with the funds we recover to strengthen medicare  now if we act in these areasminimum wage family leave child care health care the safety of our childrenthen we will begin to meet our generations historic responsibilities to strengthen our families for the 21st century  today america is the most dynamic competitive jobcreating economy in history but we can do even better in building a 21st century economy that embraces all americans  todays income gap is largely a skills gap last year the congress passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the training they need and i applaud all of you here who were part of that  this year i recommend a fiveyear commitment to the new system so that we can provide over the next five years appropriate training opportunities for all americans who lose their jobs and expand rapid response teams to help all towns which have been really hurt when businesses close i hope you will support this  also i ask your support for a dramatic increase in federal support for adult literacy to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the millions and millions of working people who still read at less than a fifthgrade level we need to do this  heres some good news in the past six years we have cut the welfare rolls nearly in half  two years ago from this podium i asked five companies to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare tonight our welfaretowork partnership includes 10000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people and our balanced budget will help another 200000 people move to the dignity and pride of work i hope you will support it  we must bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of america to build a bridge from wall street to appalachia to the mississippi delta to our native american communities with more support for community development banks for empowerment zones for 100000 more vouchers for affordable housing  and i ask congress to support our bold new plan to help businesses raise up to 15 billion in private sector capital to bring jobs and opportunities and inner cities rural areas with tax credits loan guarantees including the new american private investment companies modeled on the overseas private investment companies  now for years and years weve had this opic this overseas private investment corporation because we knew we had untapped markets overseas but our greatest untapped markets are not overseasthey are right here at home and we should go after them  we must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm  as this congress knows very well dropping prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many family farmers last year the congress provided substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in american agriculture and i am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm income assistance  i ask you to join with me and do this this should not be a political issue everyone knows what an economic problem is going on out there in rural america today and we need an appropriate means to address it  we must strengthen our lead in technology it was government investment that led to the creation of the internet i propose a 28percent increase in longterm computing research  we also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment by solving the socalled y2k computer problem we had one member of congress stand up and applaud and we may have about that ration out there applauding at home in front of their television sets but remember this is a big big problem and weve been working hard on it already weve made sure that the social security checks will come on time  but i want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we need every state and local government every business large and small to work with us to make sure that this y2k computer bug will be remembered as the last headache of the 20th century not the first crisis of the 21st  for our own prosperity we must support economic growth abroad you know until recently a third of our economic growth came from exports but over the past year and a half financial turmoil has put that growth at risk today much of the world is in recession with asia hit especially hard this is the most serious financial crisis in half a century  to meet it the us and other nations have reduced interest rates and strengthened the international monetary fund and while the turmoil is not over we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it  at the same time we will continue to work on the longterm project building a global financial system for the 21st century that promotes prosperity and tames the cycle of boom and bust that has engulfed so much of asia this june i will meet with other world leaders to advance this historic purpose and i ask all of you to support our endeavors i also ask you to support creating a freer and fairer trading system for 21st century america  you know id like to say something really serious to everyone in this chamber in both parties i think trade has divided us and divided americans outside this chamber for too long somehow we have to find a common ground on which business and workers and environmentalists and farmers and government can stand together i believe these are the things we ought to all agree on so let me try  first we ought to tear down barriers open markets and expand trade but at the same time we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all countries actually benefit from trade a trade that promotes the dignity of work and the rights of workers and protects the environment  we must insist that international trade organizations be open to public scrutiny instead of mysterious secret things subject to wild criticism  when you come right down to it now that the world economy is becoming more and more integrated we have to do in the world what we spent the better part of this century doing here at home we have got to put a human face on the global economy  now we must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our nation i have already informed the government of japan if that nations sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed america will respond  we must help all manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis with loan guarantees and other incentives to increase american exports by nearly 2 billion id like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade based on these principles and i ask the congress to join me again in this common approach and to give the president the trade authority long used and now overdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st century  tonight i issue a call to the nations of the world to join the united states in a new round of global trade negotiation to expand exports of services manufactures and farm products  tonight i say we will work with the international labor organization on a new initiative to raise labor standards around the world and this year we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world  if we do these thingsinvest in our people our communities our technologyand lead in the global economy then we will begin to meet our historic responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for america  you know no nation in history has had the opportunity and the responsibility we now have to shape a world that is more peaceful more secure more free  all americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in northern ireland  all americans can be proud that our leadership has put bosnia on the path to peace and with our nato allies we are pressing the serbian government to stop its brutal repression in kosovoto bring those responsible to justice and to give the people of kosovo the selfgovernment they deserve  all americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting peace in the middle east some of you were with me last december as we watched the palestinian national council completely renounce its call for the destruction of israel  now i ask congress to provide resources so that all parties can implement the wye agreement to protect israels security to stimulate the palestinian economy to support our friends in jordan we must not we dare not let them down i hope you will help me  as we work for peace we must also meet threats to our nations security including increased danger from outlaw nations and terrorism  we will defend our security wherever we are threatened as we did this summer when we struck at osama bin ladens network of terror the bombing of our embassies in kenya and tanzania reminds us again of the risks faced every day by those who represent america to the world so lets give them the support they need the safest possible workplaces and the resources they must have so america can continue to lead  we must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks we must work to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergencies to support research into vaccines and treatments we must increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles from korea to india and pakistan we must expand our work with russia ukraine and other former soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology so they never fall into the wrong hands our balanced budget will increase funding for these critical efforts by almost twothirds over the next five years  with russia we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals the start ii treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for start iii could cut them by 80 percent from their cold war height  its been two years since i signed the comprehensive test ban treaty if we dont do the right thing other nations wont either i ask the senate to take this vital step approve the treaty now to make it harder for other nations to develop nuclear arms and to make sure we can end nuclear testing for ever  for nearly a decade iraq has defied its obligations to destroy its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them  america will continue to contain iraqi president saddam hussein and we will work for the day when iraq has a government worthy of its people now last month in our action over iraq our troops were superb their mission was so flawlessly executed that we risk taking for granted the bravery and skill it required captain jeff taliaferro a 10year air force veteran of the air force flew a b1b bomber over iraq as we attacked saddams war machine he is here with us tonight i would like to ask you to honor him and all the 33000 men and women of operation desert fox  it is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in 1985  since april together we have added nearly 6 billion to maintain our military readiness my balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over the next six years for readiness for modernization and for pay and benefits for our troops and their families  you know we are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every community in america by millions of our veterans americas defenders today still stand ready at a moments notice to go where comforts are few and dangers are many to do what needs to be done as no one else can they always come through for america we must come through for them  the new century demands new partnerships for peace and security the united nations plays a crucial role with allies sharing burdens america might otherwise bear alone america needs a strong and effective un i want to work with this new congress to pay our dues and our debts  we must continue to support security and stability in europe and asia expanding nato and defining its new missions maintaining our alliance with japan with korea with our other asian allies and engaging china  in china last year i said to the leaders and the people what id like to say again tonight stability can no longer be bought at the expense of liberty  but id also like to say again to the american people its important not to isolate china the more we bring china into the world the more the world will bring change and freedom to china  last spring with some of you i traveled to africa where i saw democracy and reform rising but still held back by violence and disease we must fortify african democracy and peace by launching radio democracy for africa supporting the transition to democracy now beginning to take place in nigeria and passing the african trade and development act  we must continue to deepen our ties to the americas and the caribbean our common work to educate children fight drugs strengthen democracy and increase trade in this hemisphere every government but one is freely chosen by its people we are determined that cuba too will know the blessings of liberty  the american people have opened their arms and their hearts and their arms to our central american and caribbean neighbors who have been so devastated by the recent hurricanes working with congress i am committed to help them rebuild  when the first lady and tipper gore visited the region they saw thousands of our troops and thousands of american volunteers in the dominican republic hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by dominicans and americans working side by side with her was some one else who has been very important to the relief efforts you know sports records are made and sooner or later theyre broken but making other peoples lives better and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood that lasts forever so for far more than baseball sammy sosa youre a hero in two countries tonight thank you  so i say to all of you if we do these things if we pursue peace fight terrorism increase our strength renew our alliances we will begin to meet our generations historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st century america in a freer more peaceful world  as the world has changed so have our own communities we must make the safer more livable and more united this year we will reach our goal of 100000 community police officers ahead of schedule and under budget  the brady bill has stopped a quarter million felons fugitives and stalkers from buying handguns and now the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years and the crime rate has dropped for six straight years  tonight i propose a 21st century crime bill to deploy the latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer our balanced budget will help put up to 50000 more police on the street in the areas hardest hit by crime and then to equip them with new tools from crimemapping computers to digital mug shots we must break the deadly cycle of drugs and crime  our budget expands support for drug testing and treatment saying to prisoners if you stay on drugs you have to stay behind bars and to those on parole if you want to keep your freedom you must stay free of drugs  i ask congress to restore the fiveday waiting period for buying a handgun and extend the brady bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes from buying a gun  we must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our communities last year every american was horrified and heartbroken by the tragic killings in jonesboro paducah pearl edinboro springfield we were deeply moved by the courageous parents now working to keep guns out of the hands of children and to make other efforts so that other parents dont have to live through their loss  after she lost her daughter suzann wilson of jonesboro arkansas came here to the white house with a powerful plea she said please please for the sake of your children lock up your guns dont let what happened in jonesboro happen in your town  its a message she is passionately advocating every day suzann is here with us tonight with the first lady i would like to thank her for her courage and her commitment  in memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence i ask you to strengthen the safe and drug free school act to pass legislation to require child trigger locks to do everything possible to keep our children safe  today wereexcuse mea century ago president theodore roosevelt defined our great central task as leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us today were restoring the florida everglades saving yellowstone preserving the red rock canyons of utah protecting californias redwoods and our precious coasts  but our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming nineteen ninetyeight was the warmest year ever recorded last years heat waves floods and storm are but a hint of what future generations may endure if we do not act now  tonight i propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce greenhouse and other pollutions and tax incentives and investment to spur clean energy technologies and i want to work with members of congress in both parties to reward companies that take early voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gases  now all our communities face a preservation challenge as they grow and green space shrinks seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are lost every day in response i propose two major initiatives first a 1 billion livability agenda to help communities save open space ease traffic congestion and grow in ways that enhance every citizens quality of life and second a 1 billion lands legacy initiative to preserve places of natural beauty all across america from the most remote wilderness to the nearest city park  these are truly landmark initiatives which could not have been developed without the visionary leadership of the vice president and i want to thank him very much for his commitment here thank you  now to get the most out of your community you have to give something back thats why we created americorps our national service program that gives todays generation a chance to serve their communities and earn money for college  so far in just four years 100000 young americans have built lowincome homes with habitat for humanity helped tutor children with churches work with fema to ease the burden of natural disasters and performed countless other acts of service that has made america better i ask congress to give more young americans the chance to follow their lead and serve america in americorps  now we must work to renew our national community as well for the 21st century last year the house passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation sponsored by representatives christopher shays rconn and martin t meehan dmass and sens john mccain rariz and russell feingold dwis but a partisan minority in the senate blocked reform so i would like to say to the house pass it againquickly  and id like to say to the senate i hope you will say yes to a stronger american democracy in the year 2000  since 1997 our initiative on race has sought to bridge the divides between and among our people in its report last fall the initiatives advisory board found that americans really do want to bring our people together across racial lines  we know its been a long journey for some it goes back to before the beginning of our republic for others back since the civil war for others throughout the 21st century but for most of us alive today in a very real sense this journey began 43 years ago when a woman named rosa parks sat down on a bus in alabama and wouldnt get up  shes sitting down with the first lady tonight and she may get up or not as she chooses  we know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated as the presidential initiative said by opportunity gaps  the initiative ive outlined tonight will help to close them but we know that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed either discrimination or violence because of race or religion ancestry or gender disability or sexual orientation is wrong and it ought to be illegal therefore i ask congress to make the employment nondiscrimination act and the hate crimes prevention act the law of the land  you know now since every person in america counts every american ought to be counted we need a census that uses modern scientific methods to do that  our new immigrants must be part of our one america after all theyre revitalizing our cities theyre energizing our culture theyre building up our economy we have a responsibility to make them welcome here and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of american life  that means learning english and learning about our democratic system of government there are now long waiting lines of immigrants that are trying to do just that  therefore our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them meet their responsibility i hope you will support it  whether our ancestors came here on the mayflower on slave ships whether they came to ellis island or lax in los angeles whether they came yesterday or walked this land 1000 years ago our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be one america we can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as one america  you know barely more than 300 days from now we will cross that bridge into the new millennium this is a moment as the first lady has said to honor the past and imagine the future  id like to take just a minute to honor her for leading our millennium project for all shes done for our children for all she has done in her historic role to serve our nation and our best ideals at home and abroad i honor her  last yearlast year i called on congress and every citizen to mark the millennium by saving americas treasures hillarys traveled all across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like thomas edisons invention factory or harriet tubmans home  now we have to preserve our treasures in every community and tonight before i close i want to invite every town every city every community to become a nationally recognized millennium community by launching projects that save our history promote our arts and humanities prepare our children for the 21st century  already the response has been remarkable and i want to say a special word of thanks to our private sector partners and to members in congress of both parties for their support just one example because of you the star spangled banner will be preserved for the ages  in ways large and small as we look to the millennium we are keeping alive what george washington called the sacred fire of liberty  six years ago i came to office in a time of doubt for america with our economy troubled our deficit high our people divided some even wondered whether our best days were behind us but across this nation in a thousand neighborhoods i have seen even amidst the pain and uncertainty of recession the real heart and character of america  i knew then we americans could renew this country  tonight as i deliver the last state of the union address for the 20th century no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring resolve and boundless capacity of the american people to work toward that more perfect union of our founders dreams  we are now at the end of a century when generation after generation of americans answered the call to greatness overcoming depression lifting up the dispossessed bringing down barriers to racial prejudice building the largest middle class in history winning two world wars and the long twilight struggle of the cold war  we must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievements of our forbearers in this century  yet perhaps in the daily press of events in the clash of controversy we dont see our own time for what it truly isa new dawn for america  a hundred years from tonight another american president will stand in this place and report on the state of the union heor shewill look back on the 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now  so let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time but of their time that we reached as high as our ideals that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love  my fellow americans this is our moment let us lift our eyes as one nation and from the mountaintop of this american century look ahead to the next oneasking gods blessing on our endeavors and on our beloved country  thank you and good evening  
206, State of the Union Address, William J. Clinton,2000-01-27,  mr speaker mr vice president members of congress honored guests my fellow americans  we are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history never before has our nation enjoyed at once so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats never before have we had such a blessed opportunityand therefore such a profound obligation to build the more perfect union of our founders dreams  we begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years the lowest poverty rates in 20 years the lowest africanamerican and hispanic unemployment rates on record the first backtoback budget surpluses in 42 years  next month america will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history  we have built a new economy  our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the american spirit crime down by 20 percent to its lowest level in 25 years teen births down seven years in a row and adoptions up by 30 percent welfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years  my fellow americans the state of our union is the strongest it has ever been  as always the credit belongs to the american people  my gratitude also goes to those of you in this chamber who have worked with us to put progress above partisanship  eight years ago it was not so clear to most americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000 then our nation was gripped by economic distress social decline political gridlock the title of a bestselling book asked america what went wrong  in the best traditions of our nation americans determined to set things right we restored the vital center replacing outdated ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic enduring values opportunity for all responsibility from all and a community of all americans  we reinvented government transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility and give our people the tools to solve their own problems  with the smallest federal workforce in 40 years we turned record deficits into record surpluses and doubled our investment in education we cut crime with 100000 community police and the brady law which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals  we ended welfare as we knew itrequiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children and investing more in child care transportation and housing to help their parents go to work we have helped parents to succeed at work and at homewith family leave which 20 million americans have used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one we have engaged 150000 young americans in citizen service through americorpswhile also helping them earn their way through college  in 1992 we had a roadmap today we have results more important america again has the confidence to dream big dreams but we must not let our renewed confidence grow into complacency we will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children and on that score we will be held to a high standard indeed because our chance to do good is so great  my fellow americans we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century now we must shape a 21stcentury american revolutionof opportunity responsibility and community we must be as we were in the beginning a new nation  at the dawn of the last century theodore roosevelt said the one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight   it should be the growing nation with a future which takes the long look ahead  tonight let us take our look long aheadand set great goals for our nation  to 21st century america let us pledge that  every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed every family will be able to succeed at home and at workand no child will be raised in poverty we will meet the challenge of the aging of america we will assure quality affordable healthcare for all americans we will make america the safest big country on earth we will bring prosperity to every american community we will reverse the course of climate change and leave a cleaner safer planet america will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology and we will become at last what our founders pledged us to be so long agoone nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all  these are great goals worthy of a great nation we will not reach them all this year not even in this decade but we will reach them let us remember that the first american revolution was not won with a single shot the continent was not settled in a single year the lesson of our historyand the lesson of the last seven yearsis that great goals are reached step by step always building on our progress always gaining ground  of course you cant gain ground if youre standing still for too long this congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities lets begin with them  i ask you again to pass a real patients bill of rights pass commonsense gunsafety legislation pass campaign finance reform vote on long overdue judicial nominations and other important appointees and again i ask you to raise the minimum wage  two years ago as we reached our first balanced budget i asked that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal discipline because we refused to stray from that path we are doing something that would have seemed unimaginable seven years ago we are actually paying down the national debt if we stay on this path we can pay down the debt entirely in 13 years and make america debtfree for the first time since andrew jackson was president in 1835  in 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the deficit reduction act winning passage in both houses by just one vote your former colleague my first secretary of the treasury led that effort he is here tonight lloyd bentsen you have served america well  beyond paying off the debt we must ensure that the benefits of debt reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every americansocial security and medicare i ask you tonight to work with me to make a bipartisan down payment on social security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the social security trust fund to ensure that it is strong and sound for the next 50 years  but this is just the start of our journey now we must take the right steps toward reaching our great goals  opportunity and responsibility in education  first and foremost we need a 21st century revolution in education guided by our faith that every child can learn because education is more than ever the key to our childrens future we must make sure all our children have that key that means quality preschool and afterschool the best trained teachers in every classroom and college opportunities for all our children  for seven years we have worked hard to improve our schools with opportunity and responsibility investing more but demanding more in return  reading math and college entrance scores are up and some of the most impressive gains are in schools in poor neighborhoods  all successful schools have followed the same proven formula higher standards more accountability so all children can reach those standards i have sent congress a reform plan based on that formula it holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results each year the national government invests more than 15 billion in our schools its time to support what works and stop supporting what doesnt  as we demand more than ever from our schools we should invest more than ever in our schools  lets double our investment to help states and districts turn around their worstperforming schoolsor shut them down  lets double our investment in afterschool and summer school programs boosting achievement and keeping children off the street and out of trouble if we do we can give every child in every failing school in america the chance to meet high standards  since 1993 weve nearly doubled our investment in head start and improved its quality tonight i ask for another 1 billion to head start the largest increase in the programs history  we know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers for two years in a row congress has supported my plan to hire 100000 new qualified teachers to lower class sizes in the early grades this year i ask you to make it three in a row  and to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach tonight i propose a new teacher quality initiativeto recruit more talented people into the classroom reward good teachers for staying there and give all teachers the training they need  we know charter schools provide real public school choice when i became president there was just one independent public charter school in all america today there are 1700 i ask you to help us meet our goal of 3000 by next year  we know we must connect all our classrooms to the internet were getting there in 1994 only three percent of our classrooms were connected today with the help of the vice presidents erate program more than half of them are and 90 percent of our schools have at least one connection to the internet  but we cant finish the job when a third of all schools are in serious disrepair many with walls and wires too old for the internet tonight i propose to help 5000 schools a year make immediate urgent repairs and again to help build or modernize 6000 schools to get students out of trailers and into hightech classrooms  we should double our bipartisan gear up program to mentor 14 million disadvantaged young people for college and lets offer these students a chance to take the same college testprep courses wealthier students use to boost their test scores  to make the american dream achievable for all we must make college affordable for all for seven years on a bipartisan basis we have taken action toward that goal larger pell grants moreaffordable student loans education iras and our hope scholarships which have already benefited 5 million young people 67 percent of high school graduates now go on to college up almost 10 percent since 1993 yet millions of families still strain to pay college tuition they need help  i propose a landmark 30billion college opportunity tax cuta middleclass tax deduction for up to 10000 in college tuition costs weve already made two years of college affordable for all now lets make four years of college affordable for all  if we take all these steps we will move a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed  rewarding work and strengthening families  we need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen families by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most important work of allraising their children that means making sure that every family has health care and the support to care for aging parents the tools to bring their children up right and that no child grows up in poverty  from my first days as president we have worked to give families better access to better health care in 1997 we passed the childrens health insurance programchipso that workers who dont have health care coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children so far weve enrolled 2 million children and were well on our way to our goal of 5 million  but there are still more than 40 million americans without health insurance more than there were in 1993 tonight i propose that we follow vice president gores suggestion to make low income parents eligible for the insurance that covers their kids together with our childrens initiative we can cover nearly one quarter of the uninsured in america  again i ask you to let people between 55 and 65the fastest growing group of uninsuredbuy into medicare and lets give them a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one  when the baby boomers retire medicare will be faced with caring for twice as many of our citizensand yet it is far from ready to do so my generation must not ask our childrens generation to shoulder our burden we must strengthen and modernize medicare now  my budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform medicare to make it more efficient and competitive and it dedicates nearly 400 billion of our budget surplus to keep medicare solvent past 2025 and at long last to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drugs  lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine no one creating a medicare program today would even consider excluding coverage for prescription drugs yet more than three in five seniors now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives millions of older americans who need prescription drugs the most pay the highest prices for them  in good conscience we cannot let another year pass without extending to all seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs  record numbers of americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home last year i proposed a 1000 tax credit for longterm care frankly that wasnt enough this year lets triple it to 3000and this year lets pass it  and we must make needed investments to expand access to mental health care i want to thank the person who has led our efforts to break down the barriers to the decent treatment of mental illness tipper gore  taken together these proposals would mark the largest investment in health care in the 35 years since the creation of medicarea big step toward assuring health care for all americans young and old  we must also make investments that reward work and support families nothing does that better than the earned income tax credit the eitc the e in eitc is about earning working taking responsibility and being rewarded for it in my first address to you i asked congress to greatly expand this tax credit and you did as a result in 1998 alone the eitc helped more than 43 million americans work their way out of poverty and toward the middle classdouble the number in 1993  tonight i propose another major expansion we should reduce the marriage penalty for the eitc making sure it rewards marriage just as it rewards work and we should expand the tax credit for families with more than two children to provide up to 1100 more in tax relief  we cant reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for equal work the female unemployment rate is the lowest in 46 years yet women still earn only about 75 cents for every dollar men earn we must do better by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws training more women for highpaying hightech jobs and passing the paycheck fairness act  twothirds of new jobs are in the suburbs far away from many lowincome families in the past two years i have proposed and congress has approved 110000 new housing vouchersrent subsidies to help working families live closer to the workplace this year let us more than double that number if we want people to go to work they have to be able to get to work  many working parents spend up to a quarter of their income on child care last year we helped parents provide child care for about two million children my child care initiative along with funds already secured in welfare reform would make child care better safer and more affordable for another 400000 children  for hardpressed middleincome families we should also expand the child care tax credit and we should take the next big step we should make that tax credit refundable for lowincome families for those making under 30000 a year that could mean up to 2400 for childcare costs we all say were prowork and profamily passing this proposal would prove it  tens of millions of americans live from paycheck to paycheck as hard as they work they still dont have the opportunity to save too few can make use of iras and 401k retirement plans we should do more to help working families save and accumulate wealth thats the idea behind socalled individual development accounts lets take that idea to a new level with retirement savings accounts that enable every low and moderateincome family in america to save for retirement a first home a medical emergency or a college education i propose to match their contributions however small dollar for dollar every year they save and to give a major new tax credit for any small business that provides a meaningful pension to its workers  nearly one in three american children grows up in a home without a father these children are five times more likely to live in poverty than children with both parents at home clearly demanding and supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all children out of poverty  we have doubled child support collections since 1992 and i am proposing tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible but we should recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their childrenand need help to do it carlos rosas of st paul minnesota got that help now he has a good job and he supports his son ricardo my budget will help 40000 fathers make the choices carlos did and i thank him for being here  if there is any issue on which we can reach across party lines it is in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this congress we have improved foster care supported those who leave it when they turn eighteen and dramatically increased the number of foster children going to adoptive homes i thank you for that of course i am especially grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning and who has worked tirelessly for children and families for thirty years now my wife hillary  if we take all these steps we will move a long way toward empowering parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised in poverty we can make these vital investments in health care education and support for working familiesand still offer tax cuts to help pay for college for retirement to care for aging parents and reduce the marriage penaltywithout forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us here indeed we must make these investments and tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of social security and medicare and pays down the national debt  responsibility and crime  crime in america has dropped for the past seven yearsthe longest decline on record thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police sensible gun safety laws and effective prevention but nobody believes america is safe enough so lets set a higher goal lets make america the safest big country in the world  last fall congress supported my plan to hirein addition to the 100000 community police we have already funded50000 more concentrated in highcrime neighborhoods i ask your continued support  soon after the columbine tragedy congress considered commonsense gun safety legislation to require brady background checks at gun shows child safety locks for all new handguns and a ban on the importation of largecapacity ammunition clips with courageand a tiebreaking vote by the vice presidentthe senate faced down the gun lobby stood up for the american people and passed this legislation but the house failed to follow suit  weve all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands daniel mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at columbine he was an amazing kid a straighta student a good skier like all parents who lose their children his father tom has borne unimaginable grief somehow tom has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into action earlier this month he took a leave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws i pray that his courage and wisdom will move this congress to make commonsense gun safety legislation the very next order of business tom thank you for being here tonight  we must strengthen gun laws and better enforce laws already on the books federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since i took office but again we must do more i propose to hire more federal and local gun prosecutors and more atf agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and badapple dealers and we must give law enforcement the tools to trace every gunand every bulletused in a crime in america  listen to this the accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the united states is nine times higher than in the other 25 industrialized nationscombined technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them i ask congress to fund research in smart gun technology i also call on responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands and keep our children safe  every parent i know worries about the impact of violence in the media on their children i thank the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on tv programs and video and internet games but the ratings are too numerous diverse and confusing to be really useful to parents therefore i now ask the industry to accept the first ladys challengeto develop a single voluntary rating system for all childrens entertainment one that is easier for parents to understand and enforce  if we take all these steps we will be well on our way to making america the safest big country in the world  opening new markets  to keep our historic economic expansion going we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets start new businesses and hire new workers right here in americain our inner cities poor rural areas and on indian reservations  our nations prosperity has not yet reached these places over the last six months i have traveled to many of themjoined by many of you and many farsighted business peopleto shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in communities from appalachia to the mississippi delta from watts to the pine ridge indian reservation everywhere ive gone ive met talented people eager for opportunity and able to work lets put them to work  for business its the smart thing to do for america its the right thing to do and if we dont do it now when will we ever get around to it  i ask congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in americas new markets that they now have to invest in foreign markets tonight i propose a large new markets tax credit and other incentives to spur 22 billion in privatesector capitalto create new businesses and new investments in inner cities and rural areas  empowerment zones have been creating these opportunities for five years now we should also increase incentives to invest in them and create more of them  this is not a democratic or a republican issue it is an american issue mr speaker it was a powerful moment last november when you joined me and the reverend jesse jackson in your home state of illinois and committed to working toward our common goal by combining the best ideas from both sides of the aisle mr speaker i look forward to working with you  we must maintain our commitment to community development banks and keep the community reinvestment act strong so all americans have access to the capital they need to buy homes and build businesses  we need to make special efforts to address the areas with the highest rates of poverty my budget includes a special 110 million initiative to promote economic development in the mississippi delta and 1 billion to increase economic opportunity health care education and law enforcement for native american communities in this new century we should honor our historic responsibility to empower the first americans i thank leaders and members from both parties who have already expressed an interest in working with us on these efforts  theres another part of our american community in trouble todayour family farmers when i signed the farm bill in 1996 i said there was a great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad well droughts floods and historically low prices have made times very bad for our farmers we must work together to strengthen the farm safety net invest in land conservation and create new markets by expanding our program for biobased fuels and products  today opportunity for all requires something new having access to a computer and knowing how to use it that means we must close the digital divide between those who have these tools and those who dont  connecting classrooms and libraries to the internet is crucial but its just a start my budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach 21st century skills and creates technology centers in 1000 communities to serve adults this spring i will invite hightech leaders to join me on another new markets tourto close the digital divide and open opportunity for all our people i thank the hightech companies that are already doing so much in this areaand i hope the new tax incentives i have proposed will encourage others to join us  if we take these steps we will go a long way toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community  global change and american leadership  to realize the full possibilities of the new economy we must reach beyond our own borders to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals economies and cultures globalization  it is the central reality of our time change this profound is both liberating and threatening but there is no turning back and our open creative society stands to benefit more than any otherif we understand and act on the new realities of interdependence we must be at the center of every vital global network as a good neighbor and partner we cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs  first we must forge a new consensus on trade those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade must ensure that it lifts both our living standards and our values never tolerating abusive child labor or a race to the bottom on the environment and worker protection still open markets and rulesbased trade are the best engines we know for raising living standards reducing global poverty and environmental destruction and assuring the free flow of ideas there is only one direction for america on trade we must go forward  and we must make developing economies our partners in prosperitywhich is why i ask congress to finalize our groundbreaking african and caribbean basin trade initiatives  globalization is about more than economics our purpose must be to bring the world together around democracy freedom and peace and to oppose those who would tear it apart  here are the fundamental challenges i believe america must meet to shape the 21st century world  first we must continue to encourage our former adversaries russia and china to emerge as stable prosperous democratic nations both are being held back from reaching their full potential russia by the legacy of communism economic turmoil a cruel and selfdefeating war in chechnya china by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom but think how much has changed in the past decade thousands of former soviet nuclear weapons eliminated russian soldiers serving with ours in the balkans russian people electing their leaders for the first time in a thousand years and in china an economy more open to the world than ever before no one can know for sure what direction these great countries will choose but we must do everything in our power to increase the chance they will choose wisely to be constructive members of the global community  that is why we must support those russians struggling for a democratic prosperous future continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals and help russia safeguard weapons and materials that remain  that is why congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring china into the wto by passing permanent normal trade relations as soon as possible this year our markets are already open to china this agreement will open chinas markets to us and it will advance the cause of peace in asia and promote the cause of change in china  a second challenge is to protect our security from conflicts that pose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity america cannot prevent every conflict or stop every outrage but where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference we must be peacemakers  we should be proud of americas role in bringing the middle east closer than ever to a comprehensive peace building peace in northern ireland working for peace in east timor and africa promoting reconciliation between greece and turkey and in cyprus working to defuse crises between india and pakistan defending human rights and religious freedom  and we should be proud of the men and women of our armed forces and those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in kosovoenabling a million innocent people to return to their homes  when slobodan milosevic unleashed his terror on kosovo captain john cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide and when another american plane went down over serbia he flew into the teeth of enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home thanks to our armed forces skill and bravery we prevailed without losing a single american in combat captain cherrey we honor you and promise to finish the job you began  a third challenge is to keep the inexorable march of technology from giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our defenses the same advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use  we must meet this threat by making effective agreements to restrain nuclear and missile programs in north korea curbing the flow of lethal technology to iran preventing iraq from threatening its neighbors increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals and developing a system to defend against new missile threatswhile working to preserve our antiballistic missile treaty with russia  i hope we can have a constructive bipartisan dialogue this year to build a consensus which will lead eventually to the ratification of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty  a fourth challenge is to ensure that the stability of our planet is not threatened by the huge gulf between rich and poor we cannot accept a world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy while the rest live on the bare edge of survival we must do our part with expanded trade expanded aid and the expansion of freedom  from nigeria to indonesia more people won the right to choose their leaders in 1999 than in 1989 the year the berlin wall fell we must stand by democracieslike colombia fighting narcotraffickers for its peoples lives and our childrens lives i have proposed a strong twoyear package to help colombia win this fight and i ask for your support and i will propose tough new legislation to go after what drug barons value most their money  in a world where 12 billion people live on less than a dollar a day we must do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries so they can invest in education health and economic growthas the pope and other religious leaders have urged last year congress made a down payment on americas share and i ask for your continued support  and america must help more nations break the bonds of disease last year in africa aids killed ten times as many people as war did my budget invests 150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers today i propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for diseases like malaria tb and aids i ask the private sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this cause together we can save millions of lives  our final challenge is the most important to pass a national security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the world with heightened readiness and 21st century weapons raises salaries for our service men and women protects our veterans fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war and makes good on our commitment to pay our un dues and arrears i ask you to pass this budget and i thank you for the extraordinary support you have givenrepublicans and democrats aliketo our men and women in uniform i especially want to thank secretary cohen for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to our national securityand janet cohen i thank you for tirelessly traveling the world to show our support for the troops  if we meet all these challenges america can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization  responsibility opportunity and the environment  i am grateful for the opportunities the vice president and i have had to work hard to protect the environment and finally to put to rest the notion that you cant expand the economy while protecting the environment as our economy has grown we have rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste and ensured cleaner air and water for millions of families in the past three months alone we have acted to preserve more than 40 million acres of roadless lands in our national forests and created three new national monuments  but as our communities grow our commitment to conservation must grow as well tonight i propose creating a permanent conservation fund to restore wildlife protect coastlines and save natural treasures from california redwoods to the everglades this lands legacy endowment represents by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed  last year the vice president launched a new effort to help make communities more livableso children will grow up next to parks not parking lots and parents can be home with their children instead of stuck in traffic tonight we propose new funding for advanced transit systems for saving precious open spacesfor helping major cities around the great lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life  the greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming scientists tell us that the 1990s were the hottest decade of the entire millennium if we fail to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent coastal areas will be flooded economies disrupted  many people in the united states and around the world still believe we cant cut greenhouse gas pollution without slowing economic growth in the industrial age that may have been true in the digital economy it isnt new technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even more growth for example just last week automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallonthe fruits of a unique research partnership between government and industry before you know it efficient production of biofuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gas  to speed innovations in environmental technologies i propose giving major tax incentives to businesses for the production of clean energyand to families for buying energysaving homes and appliances and the next generation of superefficient cars when they hit the showroom floor i also call on the auto industry to use available technologies to make all new cars more fuel efficient right away and on congress to make more of our cleanenergy technologies available to the developing worldcreating cleaner growth abroad and new jobs at home  the opportunity and responsibility of science and technology  in the new century innovations in science and technology will be the key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy  later this year researchers will complete the first draft of the entire human genomethe very blueprint of life it is important for all americans to recognize that your tax dollars have fueled this research and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a revolution in our ability to detect treat and prevent disease  for example researchers have identified genes that cause parkinsons disease diabetes and certain types of cancerand they are designing precision therapies that will block the harmful effects of these faulty genes for good researchers are already using this new technique to target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer soon we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of alzheimers disease scientists are also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see and microchips that would directly stimulate damaged spinal cords and allow people who are now paralyzed to stand up and walk  science and engineering innovations are also propelling our remarkable prosperity information technology alone now accounts for a third of our economic growth with jobs that pay almost 80 percent above the private sector average again we should keep in mind governmentfunded research brought supercomputers the internet and communications satellites into being soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can speak materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight and molecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power of todays fastest supercomputers  to accelerate the march of discovery across all disciplines of science and technology my budget includes an unprecedented 3 billion increase in the 21st century research fund the largest increase in civilian research in a generation  these new breakthroughs must be used in ways that reflect our most cherished values first and foremost we must safeguard our citizens privacy last year we proposed rules to protect every citizens medical records this year we will finalize those rules we have also taken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card statements and other financial records soon i will send legislation to the congress to finish that job we must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination by employers or insurers  these steps will allow america to lead toward the far frontiers of science and technologyenhancing our health environment and economy in ways we cannot even imagine today  community  at a time when science technology and the forces of globalization are bringing so many changes into our lives it is more important than ever that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in our national communities  no tie binds different people together like citizen service there is a new spirit of service in americaa movement we have supported with americorps an expanded peace corps and unprecedented new partnerships with businesses foundations and community groups partnerships to enlist 12000 companies in moving 650000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to work to battle drug abuse and aids to teach young people to read to save americas treasures to strengthen the arts to fight teen pregnancy to prevent youth violence to promote racial healing  we can do even more to help americans help each other we should help faithbased organizations do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help young people get back on the right track with initiatives like second chance homes to help unwed teen mothers we should support americans who tithe and contribute to charities but dont earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it tonight i propose new tax incentives to allow low and middleincome citizens to get that deduction  we should do more to help new immigrants fully participate in the american communityinvesting more to teach them civics and english and since everyone in our community counts we must make sure everyone is counted in this years census  within ten years there will be no majority race in our largest state california in a little more than 50 years there will be no majority race in america in a more interconnected world this diversity can be our greatest strength just look around this chamber we have members from virtually every racial ethnic and religious background and america is stronger for it but as we have seen these differences all too often spark hatred and division even here at home  we have seen a man dragged to death in texas simply because he was black a young man murdered in wyoming simply because he was gay in the last year alone weve seen the shootings of african americans asian americans and jewish children simply because of who they were this is not the american way we must draw the line without delay we must pass the hate crimes prevention act and the employment nondiscrimination act and we should reauthorize the violence against women act  no american should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home getting a job going to school or securing a loan tonight i propose the largest ever investment to enforce americas civil rights laws protections in law must be protections in fact  last february i created the white house office of one america to promote racial reconciliation thats what hank aaron has done all his life from his days as baseballs alltime homerun king to his recent acts of healing he has always brought americans together were pleased hes with us tonight  this fall at the white house one of americas leading scientists said something we should all remember he said all human beings genetically are 999 percent the same so modern science affirms what ancient faith has always taught the most important fact of life is our common humanity  therefore we must do more than tolerate diversitywe must honor it and celebrate it  my fellow americans each time i prepare for the state of the union i approach it with great hope and expectations for our nation but tonight is specialbecause we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium behind us we see the great expanse of american achievement before us even grander frontiers of possibility  we should be filled with gratitude and humility for our prosperity and progress with awe and joy at what lies ahead and with absolute determination to make the most of it  when the framers finished crafting our constitution benjamin franklin stood in independence hall and reflected on a painting of the sun low on the horizon he said i have often wondered whether that sun was rising or setting today franklin said i have the happiness to know it is a rising sun well today because each generation of americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly lighting those frontiers of possibility we still bask in the warmth of mr franklins rising sun  after 224 years the american revolution continues we remain a new nation as long as our dreams outweigh our memories america will be forever young that is our destiny and this is our moment  thank you god bless you and god bless america  
207, State of the Union Address, George W. Bush,2001-02-27,  mr speaker mr vice president members of congress  its a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for governing our great country  i thank you for your invitation to speak here tonight  i know congress had to formally invite me and it could have been a close vote  laughter  so mr vice president i appreciate you being here to break the tie  laughter  i want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come to the white house to discuss important issues  were off to a good start  i will continue to meet with you and ask for your input  you have been kind and candid and i thank you for making a new president feel welcome  applause  the last time i visited the capitol i came to take an oath on the steps of this building  i pledged to honor our constitution and laws applause  and i asked you to join me in setting a tone of civility and respect in washington  applause  i hope america is noticing the difference because were making progress  together we are changing the tone in the nations capital and this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital because in the end we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it we will be judged by what were able to accomplish  america today is a nation with great challenges but greater resources an artist using statistics as a brush could paint two very different pictures of our country  one would have warning signs increasing layoffs rising energy prices too many failing schools persistent poverty the stubborn vestiges of racism  another picture would be full of blessings  a balanced budget big surpluses a military that is second to none a country at peace with its neighbors technology that is revolutionizing the world and our greatest strength  concerned citizens who care for our country and care for each other  neither picture is complete in and of itself  and tonight i challenge and invite congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other to direct the advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people  some of these resources will come from government  some but not all  year after year in washington budget debates seem to come down to an old tired argument  on one side those who want more government regardless of the cost on the other those who want less government regardless of the need  we should leave those arguments to the last century and chart a different course  applause  government has a role and an important role  yet too much government crowds out initiative and hard work private charity and the private economy  our new governing vision says government should be active but limited engaged but not overbearing  and my budget is based on that philosophy  it is reasonable and it is responsible  it meets our obligations and funds our growing needs  we increase spending next year for social security and medicare and other entitlement programs by 81 billion weve increased spending for discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent above the rate of inflation  my plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt  and then when money is still left over my plan returns it to the people who earned it in the first place  applause   a budgets impact is counted in dollars but measured in lives excellent schools quality health care a secure retirement a cleaner environment a stronger defense  these are all important needs and we fund them  the highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our childrens education  applause  education is not my top priority  education is my top priority and by supporting this budget youll make it yours as well  reading is the foundation of all learning  so during the next five years we triple spending adding 5 billion to help every child in america learn to read  values are important so weve tripled funding for character education to teach our children not only reading and writing but right from wrong  applause  weve increased funding to train and recruit teachers because we know a good education starts with a good teacher  and i have a wonderful partner in this effort  i like teachers so much i married one applause  laura has begun a new effort to recruit americans to the profession that will shape our future  teaching  she will travel across america to promote sound teaching practices and early reading skills in our schools and in programs such as head start  when it comes to our schools dollars alone do not always make the difference  funding is important and so is reform  so we must tie funding to higher standards and accountability for results  applause  i believe in local control of schools  we should not and we will not run public schools from washington dc  applause  yet when the federal government spends tax dollars we must insist on results children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year between grades three and eight  measuring is the only way to know whether all our children are learning  and i want to know because i refuse to leave any child behind in america  applause  critics of testing contend it distracts from learning  they talk about teaching to the test  but lets put that logic to the test  if you test a child on basic math and reading skills and youre teaching to the test youre teaching math and reading  and thats the whole idea applause  as standards rise local schools will need more flexibility to meet them  so we must streamline the dozens of federal education programs into five and let states spend money in those categories as they see fit applause  schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve and the support to do so  yet if they dont if they continue to fail we must give parents and students different options  a better public school a private school tutoring or a charter school  applause  in the end every child in a bad situation must be given a better choice because when it comes to our children failure is simply not an option applause  another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of medicare and social security and together we will do so  to meet the health care needs of all americas seniors we double the medicare budget over the next 10 years  my budget dedicates 238 billion to medicare next year alone enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for lowincome seniors  applause  no senior in america should have to choose between buying food and buying prescriptions  applause  to make sure the retirement savings of americas seniors are not diverted in any other program my budget protects all 26 trillion of the social security surplus for social security and for social security alone applause  my budget puts a priority on access to health care without telling americans what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose  many working americans do not have health care coverage so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits applause  and to provide quality care in lowincome neighborhoods over the next five years we will double the number of people served at community health care centers  applause  and we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage yet worry their insurance company doesnt care and wont pay together this congress and this president will find common ground to make sure doctors make medical decisions and patients get the health care they deserve with a patients bill of rights  applause  when it comes to their health people want to get the medical care they need not be forced to go to court because they didnt get it we will ensure access to the courts for those with legitimate claims  but first lets put in place a strong independent review   so we promote quality health care not frivolous lawsuits  applause  my budget also increases funding for medical research which gives hope to many who struggle with serious disease  our prayers tonight are with one of your own who is engaged in his own fight against cancer  a fine representative and a good man congressman joe moakley applause  i can think of no more appropriate tribute to joe than to have the congress finish the job of doubling the budget for the national institutes of health  applause  my new freedom initiative for americans with disabilities funds new technologies expands opportunities to work and makes our society more welcoming  for the more than 50 million americans with disabilities we need to break down barriers to equality applause  the budget i propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strong and free the men and women who serve in the united states military  applause  im requesting 57 billion in increased military pay and benefits and health care and housing  our men and women in uniform give america their best and we owe them our support applause  americas veterans honored their commitment to our country through their military service  i will honor our commitment to them with a milliondollar increase to ensure better access to quality care and faster decisions on benefit claims  applause  my budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxic brownfields  and i propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully funding the land and water conservation fund applause  our national parks have a special place in our countrys life our parks are places of great natural beauty and history  as good stewards we must leave them better than we found them  so i propose providing 49 billion over five years for the upkeep of these national treasures  applause  and my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the disadvantaged  we must encourage and support the work of charities and faithbased and community groups that offer help and love one person at a time  applause  these groups are working in every neighborhood in america to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children government should welcome these groups to apply for funds not discriminate against them  applause  government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers government should not fund religious activities  applause  but our nation should support the good works of these good people who are helping their neighbors in need  applause  so i propose allowing all taxpayers whether they itemize or not to deduct their charitable contributions estimates show this could encourage as much as 14 billion a year in new charitable giving money that will save and change lives  applause  our budget provides more than 700 million over the next 10 years for a federal compassion capital fund with a focused and noble mission to provide a mentor to the more than 100 million children with a parent in prison and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy teen pregnancy drug addiction and other difficult problems  applause  with us tonight is the mayor of philadelphia  please help me welcome mayor john street  applause  mayor street has encouraged faithbased and community organizations to make a significant difference in philadelphia  hes invited me to his city this summer to see compassionate action  im personally aware of just how effective the mayor is  mayor streets a democrat  applause  let the record show i lost his city big time  applause  but some things are bigger than politics  so i look forward to coming to your city to see your faithbased programs in action  applause  as government promotes compassion it also must promote justice too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our nations justice when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups instead of individuals  all our citizens are created equal and must be treated equally applause  earlier today i asked john ashcroft the attorney general to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling  its wrong and we will end it in america  applause  in so doing we will not hinder the work of our nations brave police officers  they protect us every day  often at great risk  applause  but by stopping the abuses of a few we will add to the public confidence our police officers earn and deserve applause  my budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations it has funded our nations important priorities  it has protected social security and medicare  and our surpluses are big enough that there is still money left over  many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt  i listened and i agree  applause  we owe it to our children and grandchildren to act now and i hope you will join me to pay down 2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years  applause  at the end of those 10 years we will have paid down all the debt that is available to retire  applause  that is more debt repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history  applause  we should also prepare for the unexpected for the uncertainties of the future  we should approach our nations budget as any prudent family would with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending needs  for example after a strategic review we may need to increase defense spending  we may need to increase spending for our farmers or additional money to reform medicare  and so my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs  that is one trillion additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this budget  applause  we have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent  we have funded our priorities  we paid down all the available debt  we have prepared for contingencies  and we still have money left over  yogi berra once said when you come to a fork in the road take it laughter  now we come to a fork in the road we have two choices even though we have already met our needs we could spend the money on more and bigger government  thats the road our nation has traveled in recent years  last year government spending shot up 8 percent  thats far more than our economy grew far more than personal income grew and far more than the rate of inflation  if you continue on that road you will spend the surplus and have to dip into social security to pay other bills applause  unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits so we must take a different path  applause  the other choice is to let the american people spend their own money to meet their own needs  applause  i hope you will join me in standing firmly on the side of the people you see the growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs  the people of america have been overcharged and on their behalf i am here asking for a refund applause  some say my tax plan is too big  applause  others say its too small  applause  i respectfully disagree  laughter  this plan is just right  applause  i didnt throw darts at the board to come up with a number for tax relief  i didnt take a poll or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good  i looked at problems in the tax code and calculated the cost to fix them  a tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages so we must lower the rate to 10 percent  applause  no one should pay more than a third of the money they earn in federal income taxes so we lowered the top rate to 33 percent  applause  this reform will be welcome relief for americas small businesses which often pay taxes at the highest rate  and help for small business means jobs for americans  applause  we simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax rates from the current five rates to four lower ones 10 percent 15 25 and 33 percent  in my plan no one is targeted in or targeted out  everyone who pays income taxes will get relief applause  our government should not tax and thereby discourage marriage so we reduced the marriage penalty  applause  i want to help families rear and support their children so we doubled the child credit to 1000 per child  applause  its not fair to tax the same earnings twice  once when you earn them and again when you die  so we must repeal the death tax  applause  these changes add up to significant help  a typical family with two children will save 1600 a year on their federal income taxes  now 1600 may not sound like a lot to some but it means a lot to many families  1600 buys gas for two cars for an entire year it pays tuition for a year at a community college it pays the average family grocery bill for three months  thats real money  with us tonight representing many american families are steven and josefina ramos  applause  they are from pennsylvania  applause but they could be from any one of your districts  steven is the network administrator for a school district  josefina is a spanish teacher at a charter school  and they have a twoyearold daughter  steven and josefina tell me they pay almost 8000 a year in federal income taxes  my plan will save them more than 2000  let me tell you what steven says  two thousand dollars a year means a lot to my family  if we had this money it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years time  after that steven and josefina want to start saving for liannas college education  my attitude is government should never stand in the way of families achieving their dreams  applause  and as we debate this issue always remember the surplus is not the governments money the surplus is the peoples money  applause  for lowerincome families my tax plan restores basic fairness right now complicated tax rules punish hard work  a waitress supporting two children on 25000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns above the 25000  her overtime her hardest hours are taxed at nearly 20 percent  this sends a terrible message  youll never get ahead but americas message must be different  we must honor hard work never punish it  applause  with tax relief overtime will no longer be overtaxed time for the waitress  applause people with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions  and millions of additional american families will be removed from the income tax rolls entirely  applause  tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent  the long economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering  lower interest rates will eventually help but we cannot assume they will do the job all by themselves  forty years ago and then 20 years ago two presidents one democrat one republican john f kennedy and ronald reagan advocated tax cuts to in president kennedys words get this country moving again  they knew then what we must do now  to create economic growth and opportunity we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and create jobs  applause  we must act quickly  the chairman of the federal reserve has testified before congress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic recovery  so i want to work with you to give our economy an important jumpstart by making tax relief retroactive  applause  we must act now because it is the right thing to do  we must also act now because we have other things to do  we must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenges to restructure our nations defenses to meet our growing need for energy and to reform medicare and social security  america has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promoting a distinctly american internationalism  we will work with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom  we will work for free markets free trade and freedom from oppression  nations making progress toward freedom will find america is their friend  we will promote our values  we will promote the peace and we need a strong military to keep the peace  but our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past  so ive asked the secretary of defense to review americas armed forces and prepare to transform them to meet emerging threats  my budget makes a down payment on the research and development that will be required yet in our broader transformation effort we must put strategy first then spending  our defense vision will drive our defense budget not the other way around  applause  our nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century  threats that are more widespread and less certain they range from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants in rogue nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction  to protect our own people our allies and friends we must develop and we must deploy effective missile defenses  applause  and as we transform our military we can discard cold war relics and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect todays needs  applause  a strong america is the worlds best hope for peace and freedom  yet the cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies  freedom is exported every day as we ship goods and products that improve the lives of millions of people  free trade brings greater political and personal freedom  each of the previous five presidents has had the ability to negotiate far reaching trade agreements tonight i ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority and to do so quickly applause  as we meet tonight many citizens are struggling with the high cost of energy  we have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy policy  applause  the west is confronting a major energy shortage that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty  ive asked federal agencies to work with california officials to help speed construction of new energy sources and i have direct vice president cheney commerce secretary evans energy secretary abraham and other senior members in my administration to develop a national energy policy applause  our energy demand outstrips our supply  we can produce more energy at home while protecting our environment and we must  applause we can produce more electricity to meet demand and we must  applause we can promote alternative energy sources and conservation and we must applause  america must become more energyindependent and we will applause  perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming medicare and social security  medicares finances are strained and its coverage is outdated  ninetynine percent of employerprovided health plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage medicare does not the framework for reform has been developed by senators frist and breaux and congressman thomas and now is the time to act  applause  medicare must be modernized and we must make sure that every senior on medicare can choose a health care plan that offers prescription drugs applause  seven years from now the baby boom generation will begin to claim social security benefits  every one in this chamber knows that social security is not prepared to fully fund their retirement  and we only have a couple of years to get prepared  without reform this country will one day awaken to a stark choice  either a drastic rise in payroll taxes or a radical cut in retirement benefits  there is a better way  this spring i will form a presidential commission to reform social security  the commission will make its recommendations by next fall  reform should be based on these principles it must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement  it must return social security to sound financial footing and it must offer personal savings accounts to younger workers who want them  applause  social security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system  to save the system we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe sound investments that yield a higher rate of return  ownership access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few  they are the hope of every american and we must make them the foundation of social security applause  by confronting the tough challenge of reform by being responsible with our budget we can earn the trust of the american people and we can add to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election and campaign reforms  applause  the agenda i have set before you tonight is worthy of a great nation america is a nation at peace but not a nation at rest  much has been given to us and much is expected  let us agree to bridge old divides but let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicated to great goals  bipartisan is more than minding our matters  it is doing our duty  applause  no one can speak in this capitol and not be awed by its history as so many turning points debates in these chambers have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country  and when we walk through statuary hall and see those men and women of marble were reminded of their courage and achievement  yet americas purpose is never found only in statues or history americas purpose always stands before us  our generation must show courage in a time of blessing as our nation has always shown in times of crisis  and our courage issue by issue can gather to greatness and serve our country  this is the privilege and responsibility we share and if we work together we can prove that public service is noble  we all came here for a reason  we all have things we want to accomplish and promises to keep  juntos podemos  together we can applause  we can make americans proud of their government  together we can share in the credit of making our country more prosperous and generous and just and earn from our conscience and from our fellow citizens the highest possible praise  well done good and faithful servants  thank you all  good night and god bless  applause  
208, State of the Union Address, George W. Bush,2001-09-20,  mr speaker mr president pro tempore members of congress and fellow americans  in the normal course of events presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the union  tonight no such report is needed it has already been delivered by the american people  we have seen it in the courage of passengers who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground  passengers like an exceptional man named todd beamer  and would you please help me to welcome his wife lisa beamer here tonight  applause  we have seen the state of our union in the endurance of rescuers working past exhaustion  we have seen the unfurling of flags the lighting of candles the giving of blood the saying of prayers  in english hebrew and arabic  we have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own  my fellow citizens for the last nine days the entire world has seen for itself the state of our union  and it is strong  applause  tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom  our grief has turned to anger and anger to resolution whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies justice will be done  applause  i thank the congress for its leadership at such an important time  all of america was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see republicans and democrats joined together on the steps of this capitol singing god bless america  and you did more than sing you acted by delivering 40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our military  speaker hastert minority leader gephardt majority leader daschle and senator lott i thank you for your friendship for your leadership and for your service to our country  applause  and on behalf of the american people i thank the world for its outpouring of support  america will never forget the sounds of our national anthem playing at buckingham palace on the streets of paris and at berlins brandenburg gate  we will not forget south korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in seoul or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in cairo  we will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in australia and africa and latin america  nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own  dozens of pakistanis more than 130 israelis more than 250 citizens of india men and women from el salvador iran mexico and japan and hundreds of british citizens  america has no truer friend than great britain  applause   once again we are joined together in a great cause  so honored the british prime minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity of purpose with america  thank you for coming friend  applause  on september the 11th enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country  americans have known wars  but for the past 136 years they have been wars on foreign soil except for one sunday in 1941  americans have known the casualties of war  but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning  americans have known surprise attacks  but never before on thousands of civilians  all of this was brought upon us in a single day  and night fell on a different world a world where freedom itself is under attack  americans have many questions tonight  americans are asking  who attacked our country  the evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al qaeda  they are the same murderers indicted for bombing american embassies in tanzania and kenya and responsible for bombing the uss cole  al qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime  but its goal is not making money its goal is remaking the world  and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere  the terrorists practice a fringe form of islamic extremism that has been rejected by muslim scholars and the vast majority of muslim clerics  a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of islam  the terrorists directive commands them to kill christians and jews to kill all americans and make no distinction among military and civilians including women and children  this group and its leader  a person named osama bin laden  are linked to many other organizations in different countries including the egyptian islamic jihad and the islamic movement of uzbekistan  there are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries  they are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like afghanistan where they are trained in the tactics of terror  they are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction  the leadership of al qaeda has great influence in afghanistan and supports the taliban regime in controlling most of that country  in afghanistan we see al qaedas vision for the world  afghanistans people have been brutalized  many are starving and many have fled  women are not allowed to attend school  you can be jailed for owning a television  religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate  a man can be jailed in afghanistan if his beard is not long enough  the united states respects the people of afghanistan  after all we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid  but we condemn the taliban regime  applause  it is not only repressing its own people it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists  by aiding and abetting murder the taliban regime is committing murder  and tonight the united states of america makes the following demands on the taliban  deliver to united states authorities all the leaders of al qaeda who hide in your land applause  release all foreign nationals including american citizens you have unjustly imprisoned  protect foreign journalists diplomats and aid workers in your country  close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in afghanistan and hand over every terrorist and every person in their support structure to appropriate authorities  applause  give the united states full access to terrorist training camps so we can make sure they are no longer operating  these demands are not open to negotiation or discussion  applause the taliban must act and act immediately  they will hand over the terrorists or they will share in their fate  i also want to speak tonight directly to muslims throughout the world we respect your faith  its practiced freely by many millions of americans and by millions more in countries that america counts as friends  its teachings are good and peaceful and those who commit evil in the name of allah blaspheme the name of allah  applause  the terrorists are traitors to their own faith trying in effect to hijack islam itself  the enemy of america is not our many muslim friends it is not our many arab friends  our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them  applause  our war on terror begins with al qaeda but it does not end there  it will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found stopped and defeated  applause  americans are asking why do they hate us  they hate what we see right here in this chamber  a democratically elected government  their leaders are selfappointed  they hate our freedoms  our freedom of religion our freedom of speech our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other  they want to overthrow existing governments in many muslim countries such as egypt saudi arabia and jordan  they want to drive israel out of the middle east  they want to drive christians and jews out of vast regions of asia and africa  these terrorists kill not merely to end lives but to disrupt and end a way of life  with every atrocity they hope that america grows fearful retreating from the world and forsaking our friends  they stand against us because we stand in their way  we are not deceived by their pretenses to piety  we have seen their kind before  they are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century  by sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions  by abandoning every value except the will to power  they follow in the path of fascism and nazism and totalitarianism  and they will follow that path all the way to where it ends  in historys unmarked grave of discarded lies applause  americans are asking  how will we fight and win this war   we will direct every resource at our command  every means of diplomacy every tool of intelligence every instrument of law enforcement every financial influence and every necessary weapon of war  to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network  this war will not be like the war against iraq a decade ago with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion  it will not look like the air war above kosovo two years ago where no ground troops were used and not a single american was lost in combat  our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes  americans should not expect one battle but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen  it may include dramatic strikes visible on tv and covert operations secret even in success we will starve terrorists of funding turn them one against another drive them from place to place until there is no refuge or no rest and we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists  applause  from this day forward any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the united states as a hostile regime  our nation has been put on notice  we are not immune from attack  we will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect americans today dozens of federal departments and agencies as well as state and local governments have responsibilities affecting homeland security these efforts must be coordinated at the highest level  so tonight i announce the creation of a cabinetlevel position reporting directly to me  the office of homeland security  and tonight i also announce a distinguished american to lead this effort to strengthen american security a military veteran an effective governor a true patriot a trusted friend  pennsylvanias tom ridge  applause  he will lead oversee and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and respond to any attacks that may come  these measures are essential  but the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it eliminate it and destroy it where it grows  applause  many will be involved in this effort from fbi agents to intelligence operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty  all deserve our thanks and all have our prayers  and tonight a few miles from the damaged pentagon i have a message for our military  be ready  ive called the armed forces to alert and there is a reason  the hour is coming when america will act and you will make us proud  applause  this is not however just americas fight  and what is at stake is not just americas freedom  this is the worlds fight  this is civilizations fight  this is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism tolerance and freedom  we ask every nation to join us  we will ask and we will need the help of police forces intelligence services and banking systems around the world  the united states is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded  with sympathy and with support  nations from latin america to asia to africa to europe to the islamic world  perhaps the nato charter reflects best the attitude of the world  an attack on one is an attack on all  the civilized world is rallying to americas side  they understand that if this terror goes unpunished their own cities their own citizens may be next  terror unanswered can not only bring down buildings it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments  and you know what  were not going to allow it  applause  americans are asking  what is expected of us  i ask you to live your lives and hug your children  i know many citizens have fears tonight and i ask you to be calm and resolute even in the face of a continuing threat  i ask you to uphold the values of america and remember why so many have come here  we are in a fight for our principles and our first responsibility is to live by them  no one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith  applause  i ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions  those who want to give can go to a central source of information libertyunitesorg to find the names of groups providing direct help in new york pennsylvania and virginia  the thousands of fbi agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation and i ask you to give it  i ask for your patience with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security and for your patience in what will be a long struggle  i ask your continued participation and confidence in the american economy  terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity  they did not touch its source  america is successful because of the hard work and creativity and enterprise of our people  these were the true strengths of our economy before september 11th and they are our strengths today applause  and finally please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families for those in uniform and for our great country  prayer has comforted us in sorrow and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead  tonight i thank my fellow americans for what you have already done and for what you will do  and ladies and gentlemen of the congress i thank you their representatives for what you have already done and for what we will do together  tonight we face new and sudden national challenges  we will come together to improve air safety to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights and take new measures to prevent hijacking  we will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying with direct assistance during this emergency applause  we will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home  applause  we will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act and find them before they strike applause  we will come together to take active steps that strengthen americas economy and put our people back to work  tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all new yorkers  governor george pataki and mayor rudolph giuliani applause  as a symbol of americas resolve my administration will work with congress and these two leaders to show the world that we will rebuild new york city  applause  after all that has just passed  all the lives taken and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them  it is natural to wonder if americas future is one of fear  some speak of an age of terror  i know there are struggles ahead and dangers to face  but this country will define our times not be defined by them  as long as the united states of america is determined and strong this will not be an age of terror this will be an age of liberty here and across the world applause  great harm has been done to us  we have suffered great loss  and in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment  freedom and fear are at war  the advance of human freedom  the great achievement of our time and the great hope of every time  now depends on us  our nation  this generation  will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future  we will rally the world to this cause by our efforts by our courage  we will not tire we will not falter and we will not fail  applause  it is my hope that in the months and years ahead life will return almost to normal  well go back to our lives and routines and that is good  even grief recedes with time and grace  but our resolve must not pass  each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened  well remember the moment the news came  where we were and what we were doing  some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue  some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever  and i will carry this  it is the police shield of a man named george howard who died at the world trade center trying to save others  it was given to me by his mom arlene as a proud memorial to her son this is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end applause  i will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it i will not yield i will not rest i will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the american people  the course of this conflict is not known yet its outcome is certain freedom and fear justice and cruelty have always been at war and we know that god is not neutral between them  applause  fellow citizens well meet violence with patient justice  assured of the rightness of our cause and confident of the victories to come  in all that lies before us may god grant us wisdom and may he watch over the united states of america  thank you  applause  
209, State of the Union Address, George W. Bush,2002-01-29,  thank you very much mr speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished guests fellow citizens as we gather tonight our nation is at war our economy is in recession and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers yet the state of our union has never been stronger applause  we last met in an hour of shock and suffering in four short months our nation has comforted the victims begun to rebuild new york and the pentagon rallied a great coalition captured arrested and rid the world of thousands of terrorists destroyed afghanistans terrorist training camps saved a people from starvation and freed a country from brutal oppression applause  the american flag flies again over our embassy in kabul terrorists who once occupied afghanistan now occupy cells at guantanamo bay applause and terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own applause  america and afghanistan are now allies against terror well be partners in rebuilding that country and this evening we welcome the distinguished interim leader of a liberated afghanistan chairman hamid karzai applause  the last time we met in this chamber the mothers and daughters of afghanistan were captives in their own homes forbidden from working or going to school today women are free and are part of afghanistans new government and we welcome the new minister of womens affairs doctor sima samar applause  our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the afghan people to the resolve of our coalition and to the might of the united states military applause when i called our troops into action i did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill and tonight thanks to them we are winning the war on terror applause the men and women of our armed forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the united states even 7000 miles away across oceans and continents on mountaintops and in cavesyou will not escape the justice of this nation applause  for many americans these four months have brought sorrow and pain that will never completely go away every day a retired firefighter returns to ground zero to feel closer to his two sons who died there at a memorial in new york a little boy left his football with a note for his lost father dear daddy please take this to heaven i dont want to play football until i can play with you again some day  last month at the grave of her husband michael a cia officer and marine who died in mazuresharif shannon spann said these words of farewell semper fi my love shannon is with us tonight applause  shannon i assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause is just and our country will never forget the debt we owe michael and all who gave their lives for freedom  our cause is just and it continues our discoveries in afghanistan confirmed our worst fears and showed us the true scope of the task ahead we have seen the depth of our enemies hatred in videos where they laugh about the loss of innocent life and the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design we have found diagrams of american nuclear power plants and public water facilities detailed instructions for making chemical weapons surveillance maps of american cities and thorough descriptions of landmarks in america and throughout the world  what we have found in afghanistan confirms that far from ending there our war against terror is only beginning most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on september the 11th were trained in afghanistans camps and so were tens of thousands of others thousands of dangerous killers schooled in the methods of murder often supported by outlaw regimes are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs set to go off without warning  thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners hundreds of terrorists have been arrested yet tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large these enemies view the entire world as a battlefield and we must pursue them wherever they are applause so long as training camps operate so long as nations harbor terrorists freedom is at risk and america and our allies must not and will not allow it applause  our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives first we will shut down terrorist camps disrupt terrorist plans and bring terrorists to justice and second we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the united states and the world applause  our military has put the terror training camps of afghanistan out of business yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries a terrorist underworldincluding groups like hamas hezbollah islamic jihad jaishimohammedoperates in remote jungles and deserts and hides in the centers of large cities  while the most visible military action is in afghanistan america is acting elsewhere we now have troops in the philippines helping to train that countrys armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an american and still hold hostages our soldiers working with the bosnian government seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy our navy is patrolling the coast of africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in somalia  my hope is that all nations will heed our call and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own many nations are acting forcefully pakistan is now cracking down on terror and i admire the strong leadership of president musharraf applause  but some governments will be timid in the face of terror and make no mistake about it if they do not act america will applause  our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening america or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since september the 11th but we know their true nature north korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction while starving its citizens  iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror while an unelected few repress the iranian peoples hope for freedom  iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward america and to support terror the iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade this is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizensleaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children this is a regime that agreed to international inspectionsthen kicked out the inspectors this is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world  states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world by seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger they could provide these arms to terrorists giving them the means to match their hatred they could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the united states in any of these cases the price of indifference would be catastrophic  we will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials technology and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction we will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect america and our allies from sudden attack applause and all nations should know america will do what is necessary to ensure our nations security  well be deliberate yet time is not on our side i will not wait on events while dangers gather i will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer the united states of america will not permit the worlds most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the worlds most destructive weapons applause  our war on terror is well begun but it is only begun this campaign may not be finished on our watchyet it must be and it will be waged on our watch  we cant stop short if we stop nowleaving terror camps intact and terror states uncheckedour sense of security would be false and temporary history has called america and our allies to action and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedoms fight applause  our first priority must always be the security of our nation and that will be reflected in the budget i send to congress my budget supports three great goals for america we will win this war well protect our homeland and we will revive our economy  september the 11th brought out the best in america and the best in this congress and i join the american people in applauding your unity and resolve applause now americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home im a proud member of my partyyet as we act to win the war protect our people and create jobs in america we must act first and foremost not as republicans not as democrats but as americans applause  it costs a lot to fight this war we have spent more than a billion dollars a monthover 30 million a dayand we must be prepared for future operations afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives and we need more of them we need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons the best equipment the best trainingand they also deserve another pay raise applause  my budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades because while the price of freedom and security is high it is never too high whatever it costs to defend our country we will pay applause  the next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect our citizens and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of another attack time and distance from the events of september the 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons america is no longer protected by vast oceans we are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad and increased vigilance at home  my budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security focused on four key areas bioterrorism emergency response airport and border security and improved intelligence we will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases well increase funding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic police and firefighters applause we will improve intelligence collection and sharing expand patrols at our borders strengthen the security of air travel and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of visitors to the united states applause  homeland security will make america not only stronger but in many ways better knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health stronger police and fire departments will mean safer neighborhoods stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal drugs applause and as government works to better secure our homeland america will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens  a few days before christmas an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger lighting a match the crew and passengers quickly subdued the man who had been trained by al qaeda and was armed with explosives the people on that plane were alert and as a result likely saved nearly 200 lives and tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants hermis moutardier and christina jones applause  once we have funded our national security and our homeland security the final great priority of my budget is economic security for the american people applause to achieve these great national objectivesto win the war protect the homeland and revitalize our economyour budget will run a deficit that will be small and shortterm so long as congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible manner applause we have clear priorities and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas well prevail in the war and we will defeat this recession applause  americans who have lost their jobs need our help and i support extending unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage applause yet american workers want more than unemployment checks they want a steady paycheck applause when america works america prospers so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word jobs applause  good jobs begin with good schools and here weve made a fine start applause republicans and democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind i was proud to work with members of both parties chairman john boehner and congressman george miller applause senator judd gregg applause and i was so proud of our work i even had nice things to say about my friend ted kennedy laughter and applause i know the folks at the crawford coffee shop couldnt believe id say such a thinglaughterbut our work on this bill shows what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on results applause  there is more to do we need to prepare our children to read and succeed in school with improved head start and early childhood development programs applause we must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for america a quality teacher in every classroom applause  good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy this congress must act to encourage conservation promote technology build infrastructure and it must act to increase energy production at home so america is less dependent on foreign oil applause  good jobs depend on expanded trade selling into new markets creates new jobs so i ask congress to finally approve trade promotion authority applause on these two key issues trade and energy the house of representatives has acted to create jobs and i urge the senate to pass this legislation applause  good jobs depend on sound tax policy applause last year some in this hall thought my tax relief plan was too small some thought it was too big applause but when the checks arrived in the mail most americans thought tax relief was just about right applause congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates doubling the child credit and ending the death tax for the sake of longterm growth and to help americans plan for the future lets make these tax cuts permanent applause

heroes hugged the families and looked into the tired faces of rescuers i have stood in awe of the american people  and i hope you will join mei hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one american for the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our nation in crisis our first lady laura bush applause  none of us would ever wish the evil that was done on september the 11th yet after america was attacked it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves we were reminded that we are citizens with obligations to each other to our country and to history we began to think less of the goods we can accumulate and more about the good we can do  for too long our culture has said if it feels good do it now america is embracing a new ethic and a new creed lets roll applause in the sacrifice of soldiers the fierce brotherhood of firefighters and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like we want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self weve been offered a unique opportunity and we must not let this moment pass applause  my call tonight is for every american to

kindness i know we can overcome evil with greater good applause and we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace  all fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppressed or aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police  if anyone doubts this let them look to afghanistan where the islamic street greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration let the skeptics look to islams own rich history with its centuries of learning and tolerance and progress america will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere applause  no nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them we have no intention of imposing our culture but america will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the power of the state respect for women private property free speech equal justice and religious tolerance applause  america will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values around the world including the islamic world because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment we seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror  in this moment of opportunity a common danger is erasing old rivalries america is working with russia and china and india in ways we have never before to achieve peace and prosperity in

role in human events rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential  our enemies send other peoples children on missions of suicide and murder they embrace tyranny and death as a

210, State of the Union Address, George W. Bush,2003-01-28,  mr speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished guests fellow citizens  every year by law and by custom we meet here to consider the state of the union this year we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead  you and i serve our country in a time of great consequence during this session of congress we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our countryand we have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease we will work for a prosperity that is broadly sharedand we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the american people  in all these days of promise and days of reckoning we can be confident in a whirlwind of change and hope and peril our faith is sure our resolve is firm and our union is strong  this country has many challenges we will not deny we will not ignore we will not pass along our problems to other congresses other presidents and other generations we will confront them with focus and clarity and courage  during the last two years we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together to lift the standards of our public schools we achieved historic education reform  which must now be carried out in every school and every classroom so that every child in america can read and learn and succeed in life to protect our country we reorganized our government and created the department of homeland security  which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era to bring our economy out of recession we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation to insist on integrity in american business we passed tough reforms and we are holding corporate criminals to account  some might call this a good record i call it a good start tonight i ask the house and senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens  our first goal is clear we must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job  after recession terrorist attacks corporate scandals and stock market declines our economy is recovering  yet it is not growing fast enough or strongly enough with unemployment rising our nation needs more small businesses to open more companies to invest and expand more employers to put up the sign that says help wanted  jobs are created when the economy grows the economy grows when americans have more money to spend and invest and the best fairest way to make sure americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place  i am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year and under my plan as soon as i have signed the bill this extra money will start showing up in workers paychecks instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty we should do it now instead of slowly raising the child credit to a thousand dollars we should send the checks to american families now  this tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes  and it will help our economy immediately ninetytwo million americans will keep  this year  an average of almost 1100 dollars more of their own money a family of four with an income of 40000 dollars would see their federal income taxes fall from 1178 dollars to 45 dollars per year and our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses  you the congress have already passed all these reductions and promised them for future years if this tax relief is good for americans three or five or seven years from now it is even better for americans today  we also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws it is fair to tax a companys profits it is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits to boost investor confidence and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income i ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends  lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand more jobs mean more taxpayers  and higher revenues to our government the best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth  and to show some spending discipline in washington dc we must work together to fund only our most important priorities i will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by four percent next year  about as much as the average familys income is expected to grow and that is a good benchmark for us federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of american families  a growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will also be crucial to the future of social security as we continue to work together to keep social security sound and reliable we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own  our second goal is high quality affordable health care for all americans  the american system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation  with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives yet for many people medical care costs too much  and many have no coverage at all these problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care instead we must work toward a system in which all americans have a good insurance policychoose their own doctorsand seniors and lowincome americans receive the help they need instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyers and hmos we must put doctors and nurses and patients back in charge of american medicine  health care reform must begin with medicare because medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society we must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to the preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in america  seniors happy with the current medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is and just like you the members of congress members of your staffs and other federal employees all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs my budget will commit an additional 400 billion dollars over the next decade to reform and strengthen medicare leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening medicare  i urge the members of this new congress to act this year  to improve our health care system we must address one of the prime causes of higher costs  the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued because of excessive litigation everybody pays more for health care  and many parts of america are losing fine doctors no one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit  and i urge the congress to pass medical liability reform  our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country while dramatically improving the environment  i have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation to develop cleaner technology and to produce more energy at home i have sent you clear skies legislation that mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years i have sent you a healthy forests initiative to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities kill wildlife and burn away millions of acres of treasured forest  i urge you to pass these measures for the good of both our environment and our economy even more i ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined in this century the greatest environmental progress will come about not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations but through technology and innovation tonight i am proposing 12 billion dollars in research funding so that america can lead the world in developing clean hydrogenpowered automobiles  a simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy which can be used to power a car  producing only water not exhaust fumes with a new national commitment our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom  so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollutionfree join me in this important innovation  to make our air significantly cleaner and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy  our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of america to the deepest problems of america for so many in our country  the homeless the fatherless the addicted  the need is great yet there is power  wonderworking power  in the goodness and idealism and faith of the american people  americans are doing the work of compassion every day  visiting prisoners providing shelter to battered women bringing companionship to lonely seniors these good works deserve our praisethey deserve our personal supportand when appropriate they deserve the assistance of our government i urge you to pass both my faithbased initiative and the citizen service act  to encourage acts of compassion that can transform america one heart and one soul at a time  last year i called on my fellow citizens to participate in usa freedom corps which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across america tonight i ask congress and the american people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens  boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attentionand children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad i propose a 450 million dollar initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners government will support the training and recruiting of mentors yet it is the men and women of america who will fill the need one mentor one person can change a life forever  and i urge you to be that one person  another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs addiction crowds out friendship ambition moral conviction and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire as a government we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies and reducing demand through antidrug education programs yet for those already addicted the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives  too many americans in search of treatment cannot get it so tonight i propose a new 600 million dollar program to help an additional 300000 americans receive treatment over the next three years  our nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work one of them is found at the healing place church in baton rouge louisiana a man in the program said god does miracles in people s lives and you never think it could be you tonight let us bring to all americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope the miracle of recovery is possible and it could be you  by caring for children who need mentors and for addicted men and women who need treatment we are building a more welcoming society  a culture that values every life and in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us i ask you to protect infants at the very hour of birth and end the practice of partialbirth abortion and because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment i ask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning  the qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in america also determine our conduct abroad the american flag stands for more than our power and our interests our founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity  the rights of every person and the possibilities of every life this conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted and defend the peace and confound the designs of evil men in afghanistan we helped to liberate an oppressed peopleand we will continue helping them secure their country rebuild their society and educate all their children  boys and girls in the middle east we will continue to seek peace between a secure israel and a democratic palestine across the earth america is feeding the hungry more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the united states  as our nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer we must also remember our calling as a blessed country to make this world better today on the continent of africa nearly 30 million people have the aids virus  including three million children under the age of 15 there are whole countries in africa where more than onethird of the adult population carries the infection more than four million require immediate drug treatment yet across that continent only 50000 aids victims  only 50000  are receiving the medicine they need  because the aids diagnosis is considered a death sentence many do not seek treatment almost all who do are turned away a doctor in rural south africa describes his frustration he says we have no medicinesmany hospitals tell people youve got aids we cant help you go home and die   in an age of miraculous medicines no person should have to hear those words aids can be prevented antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years and the cost of those drugs has dropped from 12000 dollars a year to under 300 dollars a year  which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp  ladies and gentlemen seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many we have confronted and will continue to confront hivaids in our own country and to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad tonight i propose the emergency plan for aids relief  a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of africa this comprehensive plan will prevent seven million new aids infectionstreat at least two million people with lifeextending drugsand provide humane care for millions of people suffering from aids and for children orphaned by aids i ask the congress to commit 15 billion dollars over the next five years including nearly ten billion dollars in new money to turn the tide against aids in the most afflicted nations of africa and the caribbean  this nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature and this nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the manmade evil of international terrorism  there are days when the american people do not hear news about the war on terror there is never a day when i do not learn of another threat or receive reports of operations in progress or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers the war goes on and we are winning  to date we have arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of alqaida they include a man who directed logistics and funding for the september 11th attacksthe chief of alqaida operations in the persian gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in east africa and the uss colean alqaida operations chief from southeast asiaa former director of alqaidas training camps in afghanistana key alqaida operative in europeand a major alqaida leader in yemen all told more than 3000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries and many others have met a different fate they are no longer a problem for the united states and our friends and allies  we are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks america and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the american embassy in yementhe american embassy in singaporea saudi military baseand ships in the straits of hormuz and the straits of gibraltar we have broken alqaida cells in hamburg and milan and madrid and london and paris  as well as buffalo new york  we have the terrorists on the run and we are keeping them on the run one by one the terrorists are learning the meaning of american justice  as we fight this war we will remember where it began  here in our own country this government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland we have intensified security at the borders and ports of entryposted more than 50000 newly trained federal screeners in airportsbegun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpoxand are deploying the nations first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack and this year for the first time we are beginning to field a defense to protect this nation against ballistic missiles  i thank the congress for supporting these measures i ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bioterrorism called project bioshield the budget i send you will propose almost six billion dollars to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax botulinum toxin ebola and plague we must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons and we must act before the dangers are upon us  since september 11th our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists the fbi is improving its ability to analyze intelligence and transforming itself to meet new threats and tonight i am instructing the leaders of the fbi central intelligence homeland security and the department of defense to develop a terrorist threat integration center to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location our government must have the very best information possible and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect our citizens  our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power in the ruins of two towers at the western wall of the pentagon on a field in pennsylvania this nation made a pledge and we renew that pledge tonight whatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulties we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of menfree people will set the course of history  today the gravest danger in the war on terrorthe gravest danger facing america and the worldis outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear chemical and biological weapons these regimes could use such weapons for blackmail terror and mass murder they could also give or sell those weapons to their terrorist allies who would use them without the least hesitation  this threat is new americas duty is familiar throughout the 20th century small groups of men seized control of great nationsbuilt armies and arsenalsand set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world in each case their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit in each case the ambitions of hitlerism militarism and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples by the strength of great alliances and by the might of the united states of america now in this century the ideology of power and domination has appeared again and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror once again this nation and our friends are all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaos and constant alarm once again we are called to defend the safety of our people and the hopes of all mankind and we accept this responsibility  america is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers we have called on the united nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that iraq disarm we are strongly supporting the international atomic energy agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world we are working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former soviet union and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction  in all of these efforts however americas purpose is more than to follow a process  it is to achieve a result the end of terrible threats to the civilized world all free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attack we are asking them to join us and many are doing so yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others whatever action is required whenever action is necessary i will defend the freedom and security of the american people  different threats require different strategies in iran we continue to see a government that represses its people pursues weapons of mass destruction and supports terror we also see iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty human rights and democracy iranians like all people have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny  and the united states supports their aspirations to live in freedom  on the korean peninsula an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation throughout the 1990s the united states relied on a negotiated framework to keep north korea from gaining nuclear weapons we now know that the regime was deceiving the world and developing those weapons all along and today the north korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions america and the world will not be blackmailed america is working with the countries of the region  south korea japan china and russia  to find a peaceful solution and to show the north korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation economic stagnation and continued hardship the north korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions  our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the korean peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in iraq a brutal dictator with a history of reckless aggressionwith ties to terrorism with great potential wealthwill not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the united states  twelve years ago saddam hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost to spare himself he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction for the next 12 years he systematically violated that agreement he pursued chemical biological and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons  not economic sanctions not isolation from the civilized world not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities almost three months ago the united nations security council gave saddam hussein his final chance to disarm he has shown instead his utter contempt for the united nations and for the opinion of the world  the 108 un weapons inspectors were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of california the job of the inspectors is to verify that iraqs regime is disarming it is up to iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weaponslay those weapons out for the world to seeand destroy them as directed nothing like this has happened  the united nations concluded in 1999 that saddam hussein had biological weapons materials sufficient to produce over 25000 liters of anthrax  enough doses to kill several million people he has not accounted for that material he has given no evidence that he has destroyed it  the united nations concluded that saddam hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38000 liters of botulinum toxin  enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure he has not accounted for that material he has given no evidence that he has destroyed it  our intelligence officials estimate that saddam hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin mustard and vx nerve agent in such quantities these chemical agents also could kill untold thousands he has not accounted for these materials he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them  us intelligence indicates that saddam hussein had upwards of 30000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents inspectors recently turned up 16 of them despite iraqs recent declaration denying their existence saddam hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29984 of these prohibited munitions he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them  from three iraqi defectors we know that iraq in the late 1990s had several mobile biological weapons labs these are designed to produce germ warfare agents and can be moved from place to place to evade inspectors saddam hussein has not disclosed these facilities he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them  the international atomic energy agency confirmed in the 1990s that saddam hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production saddam hussein has not credibly explained these activities he clearly has much to hide  the dictator of iraq is not disarming to the contrary he is deceiving from intelligence sources we know for instance that thousands of iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the un inspectors  sanitizing inspection sites and monitoring the inspectors themselves iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses iraq is blocking u2 surveillance flights requested by the united nations iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview real scientists have been coached by iraqi officials on what to say and intelligence sources indicate that saddam hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with un inspectors in disarming iraq will be killed along with their families  year after year saddam hussein has gone to elaborate lengths spent enormous sums taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction  but why the only possible explanation the only possible use he could have for those weapons is to dominate intimidate or attack with nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons saddam hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the middle east and create deadly havoc in the region and this congress and the american people must recognize another threat evidence from intelligence sources secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists including members of alqaida secretly and without fingerprints he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own  before september 11 2001 many in the world believed that saddam hussein could be contained but chemical agents and lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans  this time armed by saddam hussein it would take just one vial one canister one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known we will do everything in our power to make sure that day never comes  some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions politely putting us on notice before they strike if this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge all actions all words and all recriminations would come too late trusting in the sanity and restraint of saddam hussein is not a strategy and it is not an option  this dictator who is assembling the worlds most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages  leaving thousands of his own citizens dead blind or disfigured iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained  by torturing children while their parents are made to watch international human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of iraq electric shock burning with hot irons dripping acid on the skin mutilation with electric drills cutting out tongues and rape  if this is not evil then evil has no meaning and tonight i have a message for the brave and oppressed people of iraq your enemy is not surrounding your country  your enemy is ruling your country and the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation  the world has waited 12 years for iraq to disarm america will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country our friends and our allies the united states will ask the un security council to convene on february 5th to consider the facts of iraqs ongoing defiance of the world secretary of state powell will present information and intelligence about iraqs illegal weapons programs its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors and its links to terrorist groups we will consult but let there be no misunderstanding if saddam hussein does not fully disarm for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world we will lead a coalition to disarm him  tonight i also have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace members of the american armed forces many of you are assembling in and near the middle east and some crucial hours may lie ahead in those hours the success of our cause will depend on you your training has prepared you your honor will guide you you believe in america and america believes in you  sending americans into battle is the most profound decision a president can make the technologies of war have changed the risks and suffering of war have not for the brave americans who bear the risk no victory is free from sorrow this nation fights reluctantly because we know the cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come  we seek peace we strive for peace and sometimes peace must be defended a future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all if war is forced upon us we will fight in a just cause and by just means  sparing in every way we can the innocent and if war is forced upon us we will fight with the full force and might of the united states military  and we will prevail and as we and our coalition partners are doing in afghanistan we will bring to the iraqi people food and medicines and suppliesand freedom  many challenges abroad and at home have arrived in a single season in two years america has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of perilfrom bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes and we go forward with confidence because this call of history has come to the right country  americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time adversity has revealed the character of our country to the world and to ourselves  america is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength we exercise power without conquest and sacrifice for the liberty of strangers   americans are a free people who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation the liberty we prize is not americas gift to the world it is gods gift to humanity  we americans have faith in ourselves  but not in ourselves alone we do not claim to know all the ways of providence yet we can trust in them placing our confidence in the loving god behind all of life and all of history  may he guide us now and may god continue to bless the united states of america  thank you  
211, State of the Union Address, George W. Bush,2004-01-20,  mr speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished guests and fellow citizens america this evening is a nation called to great responsibilities and we are rising to meet them  as we gather tonight hundreds of thousands of american servicemen and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror by bringing hope to the oppressed and delivering justice to the violent they are making america more secure applause  each day law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats analysts are examining airline passenger lists the men and women of our new homeland security department are patrolling our coasts and borders and their vigilance is protecting america applause  americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world the american economy is growing stronger the tax relief you passed is working applause  tonight members of congress can take pride in the great works of compassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible youre raising the standards for our public schools and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under medicare applause  we have faced serious challenges together and now we face a choice we can go forward with confidence and resolve or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us we can press on with economic growth and reforms in education and medicare or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions  weve not come all this way  through tragedy and trial and war  only to falter and leave our work unfinished americans are rising to the tasks of history and they expect the same from us in their efforts their enterprise and their character the american people are showing that the state of our union is confident and strong applause  our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the american people twentyeight months have passed since september 11th 2001  over two years without an attack on american soil and it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us that hope is understandable comforting  and false the killing has continued in bali jakarta casablanca riyadh mombasa jerusalem istanbul and baghdad the terrorists continue to plot against america and the civilized world and by our will and courage this danger will be defeated applause  inside the united states where the war began we must continue to give our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us and one of those essential tools is the patriot act which allows federal law enforcement to better share information to track terrorists to disrupt their cells and to seize their assets for years we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers if these methods are good for hunting criminals they are even more important for hunting terrorists applause  key provisions of the patriot act are set to expire next year applause the terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule applause our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens you need to renew the patriot act applause  america is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war last march khalid shaikh mohammed a mastermind of september the 11th awoke to find himself in the custody of us and pakistani authorities last august the 11th brought the capture of the terrorist hambali who was a key player in the attack in indonesia that killed over 200 people were tracking al qaeda around the world and nearly twothirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on the manhunt going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves and one by one we will bring these terrorists to justice applause  as part of the offensive against terror we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists and could supply them with nuclear chemical or biological weapons the united states and our allies are determined we refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger applause  the first to see our determination were the taliban who made afghanistan the primary training base of al qaeda killers as of this month that country has a new constitution guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women businesses are opening health care centers are being established and the boys and girls of afghanistan are back in school with the help from the new afghan army our coalition is leading aggressive raids against the surviving members of the taliban and al qaeda the men and women of afghanistan are building a nation that is free and proud and fighting terror  and america is honored to be their friend applause  since we last met in this chamber combat forces of the united states great britain australia poland and other countries enforced the demands of the united nations ended the rule of saddam hussein and the people of iraq are free applause  having broken the baathist regime we face a remnant of violent saddam supporters men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows these killers joined by foreign terrorists are a serious continuing danger yet were making progress against them the once allpowerful ruler of iraq was found in a hole and now sits in a prison cell applause of the top 55 officials of the former regime we have captured or killed 45 our forces are on the offensive leading over 1600 patrols a day and conducting an average of 180 raids a week we are dealing with these thugs in iraq just as surely as we dealt with saddam husseins evil regime applause  the work of building a new iraq is hard and it is right and america has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right last january iraqs only law was the whim of one brutal man today our coalition is working with the iraqi governing council to draft a basic law with a bill of rights were working with iraqis and the united nations to prepare for a transition to full iraqi sovereignty by the end of june  as democracy takes hold in iraq the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear they are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends but the united states of america will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins applause the killers will fail and the iraqi people will live in freedom applause  month by month iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future and tonight we are honored to welcome one of iraqs most respected leaders the current president of the iraqi governing council adnan pachachi  sir america stands with you and the iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation applause  because of american leadership and resolve the world is changing for the better last month the leader of libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regimes weapons of mass destruction programs including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons colonel qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be better off and far more secure without weapons of mass murder applause  nine months of intense negotiations involving the united states and great britain succeeded with libya while 12 years of diplomacy with iraq did not and one reason is clear for diplomacy to be effective words must be credible and no one can now doubt the word of america applause  different threats require different strategies along with nations in the region were insisting that north korea eliminate its nuclear program america and the international community are demanding that iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons america is committed to keeping the worlds most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous regimes applause  when i came to this rostrum on september the 20th 2001 i brought the police shield of a fallen officer my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end i gave to you and to all americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies and this pledge given by one has been kept by many  you in the congress have provided the resources for our defense and cast the difficult votes of war and peace our closest allies have been unwavering americas intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless and the men and women of the american military  they have taken the hardest duty weve seen their skill and their courage in armored charges and midnight raids and lonely hours on faithful watch we have seen the joy when they return and felt the sorrow when one is lost ive had the honor of meeting our servicemen and women at many posts from the deck of a carrier in the pacific to a mess hall in baghdad  many of our troops are listening tonight and i want you and your families to know america is proud of you and my administration and this congress will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror applause  i know that some people question if america is really in a war at all they view terrorism more as a crime a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments after the world trade center was first attacked in 1993 some of the guilty were indicted and tried and convicted and sent to prison but the matter was not settled the terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations and drawing up more ambitious plans after the chaos and carnage of september the 11th it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the united states and war is what they got applause  some in this chamber and in our country did not support the liberation of iraq objections to war often come from principled motives but let us be candid about the consequences of leaving saddam hussein in power were seeking all the facts already the kay report identified dozens of weapons of mass destructionrelated program activities and significant amounts of equipment that iraq concealed from the united nations had we failed to act the dictatators weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day had we failed to act security council resolutions on iraq would have been revealed as empty threats weakening the united nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world iraqs torture chambers would still be filled with victims terrified and innocent the killing fields of iraq  where hundreds of thousands of men and women and children vanished into the sands  would still be known only to the killers for all who love freedom and peace the world without saddam husseins regime is a better and safer place applause  some critics have said our duties in iraq must be internationalized this particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in britain australia japan south korea the philippines thailand italy spain poland denmark hungary bulgaria ukraine romania the netherlands  applause  norway el salvador and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to iraq applause as we debate at home we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners or dismiss their sacrifices  from the beginning america has sought international support for our operations in afghanistan and iraq and we have gained much support there is a difference however between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country applause  we also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater middle east where freedom is rare yet it is mistaken and condescending to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and selfgovernment i believe that god has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom and even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades it will rise again applause  as long as the middle east remains a place of tyranny and despair and anger it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of america and our friends so america is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater middle east we will challenge the enemies of reform confront the allies of terror and expect a higher standard from our friend to cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda the voice of america and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in arabic and persian  and soon a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region i will send you a proposal to double the budget of the national endowment for democracy and to focus its new work on the development of free elections and free markets free press and free labor unions in the middle east and above all we will finish the historic work of democracy in afghanistan and iraq so those nations can light the way for others and help transform a troubled part of the world applause  america is a nation with a mission and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs we have no desire to dominate no ambitions of empire our aim is a democratic peace  a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman america acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side yet we understand our special calling this great republic will lead the cause of freedom applause  in the last three years adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the american economy we have come through recession and terrorist attack and corporate scandals and the uncertainties of war and because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief this economy is strong and growing stronger applause  you have doubled the child tax credit from 500 to 1000 reduced the marriage penalty begun to phase out the death tax reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends cut taxes on small businesses and you have lowered taxes for every american who pays income taxes  americans took those dollars and put them to work driving this economy forward the pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years new home construction the highest in almost 20 years home ownership rates the highest ever manufacturing activity is increasing inflation is low interest rates are low exports are growing productivity is high and jobs are on the rise applause  these numbers confirm that the american people are using their money far better than government would have  and you were right to return it applause  americas growing economy is also a changing economy as technology transforms the way almost every job is done america becomes more productive and workers need new skills much of our job growth will be found in highskilled fields like health care and biotechnology so we must respond by helping more americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy  all skills begin with the basics of reading and math which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools yet for too long for too many children those skills were never mastered by passing the no child left behind act you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country were providing more funding for our schools  a 36percent increase since 2001 were requiring higher standards we are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals we are reporting results to parents and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing we are making progress toward excellence for every child in america applause  but the status quo always has defenders some want to undermine the no child left behind act by weakening standards and accountability yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense we expect third graders to read and do math at the third grade level  and thats not asking too much testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind this nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics i refuse to give up on any child  and the no child left behind act is opening the door of opportunity to all of americas children applause  at the same time we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now many of the fastest growing occupations require strong math and science preparation and training beyond the high school level so tonight i propose a series of measures called jobs for the 21st century this program will provide extra help to middle and high school students who fall behind in reading and math expand advanced placement programs in lowincome schools invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach parttime in our high schools i propose larger pell grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school applause i propose increasing our support for americas fine community colleges so they can  applause i do so so they can train workers for industries that are creating the most new jobs by all these actions well help more and more americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country job training is important and so is job creation  we must continue to pursue an aggressive progrowth economic agenda applause congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes the tax reductions you passed are set to expire unless you act  applause  unless you act  unless you act the unfair tax on marriage will go back up unless you act millions of families will be charged 300 more in federal taxes for every child unless you act small businesses will pay higher taxes unless you act the death tax will eventually come back to life unless you act americans face a tax increase what congress has given the congress should not take away for the sake of job growth the tax cuts you passed should be permanent applause  our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employees with relief from needless federal regulation and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits applause  consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run  so i urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system promote conservation and make america less dependent on foreign sources of energy applause  my administration is promoting free and fair trade to open up new markets for americas entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers  to create jobs for american workers younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their social security taxes in a personal retirement account applause we should make the social security system a source of ownership for the american people applause and we should limit the burden of government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayers dollars applause  in two weeks i will send you a budget that funds the war protects the homeland and meets important domestic needs while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 percent applause this will require that congress focus on priorities cut wasteful spending and be wise with the peoples money by doing so we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years applause  tonight i also ask you to reform our immigration laws so they reflect our values and benefit our economy i propose a new temporary worker program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers when no americans can be found to fill the job this reform will be good for our economy because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system a temporary worker program will help protect our homeland allowing border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security  i oppose amnesty because it would encourage further illegal immigration and unfairly reward those who break our laws my temporary worker program will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law while bringing millions of hardworking men and women out from the shadows of american life applause  our nations health care system like our economy is also in a time of change amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives this dramatic progress has brought its own challenge in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance members of congress we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country applause  meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort and two months ago you showed the way by strengthening medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit you kept a basic commitment to our seniors you are giving them the modern medicine they deserve applause  starting this year under the law you passed seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs  and millions of lowincome seniors can get an additional 600 to buy medicine beginning next year seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease and seniors just entering medicare can receive wellness exams  in january of 2006 seniors can get prescription drug coverage under medicare for a monthly premium of about 35 most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half under this reform senior citizens will be able to keep their medicare just as it is or they can choose a medicare plan that fits them best  just as you as members of congress can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs and starting this year millions of americans will be able to save money taxfree for their medical expenses in a health savings account applause  i signed this measure proudly and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors or to take away their prescription drug coverage under medicare will meet my veto applause  on the critical issue of health care our goal is to ensure that americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs to make insurance more affordable congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates so they can cover more workers with health insurance i urge you to pass association health plans applause i ask you to give lowerincome americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance applause  by computerizing health records we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes reduce costs and improve care to protect the doctorpatient relationship and keep good doctors doing good work we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits applause and tonight i propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage as part of our new health savings accounts be allowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their taxes applause  a governmentrun health care system is the wrong prescription applause by keeping costs under control expanding access and helping more americans afford coverage we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes americas health care the best in the world applause  we are living in a time of great change  in our world in our economy in science and medicine yet some things endure  courage and compassion reverence and integrity respect for differences of faith and race the values we try to live by never change and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions such as families and schools and religious congregations these institutions these unseen pillars of civilization must remain strong in america and we will defend them we must stand with our families to help them raise healthy responsible children when it comes to helping children make right choices there is work for all of us to do  one of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and futures on drugs our government is helping parents confront this problem with aggressive education treatment and law enforcement drug use in high school has declined by 11 percent over the last two years four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001 applause in my budget i proposed new funding to continue our aggressive communitybased strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs drug testing in our schools has proven to be an effective part of this effort so tonight i proposed an additional 23 million for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save childrens lives the aim here is not to punish children but to send them this message we love you and we dont want to lose you applause  to help children make right choices they need good examples athletics play such an important role in our society but unfortunately some in professional sports are not setting much of an example the use of performanceenhancing drugs like steroids in baseball football and other sports is dangerous and it sends the wrong message  that there are shortcuts to accomplishment and that performance is more important than character so tonight i call on team owners union representatives coaches and players to take the lead to send the right signal to get tough and to get rid of steroids now applause  to encourage right choices we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face  even when theyre difficult to talk about each year about 3 million teenagers contract sexuallytransmitted diseases that can harm them or kill them or prevent them from ever becoming parents in my budget i propose a grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks we will double federal funding for abstinence programs so schools can teach this fact of life abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexuallytransmitted diseases applause  decisions children now make can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives all of us  parents and schools and government  must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture and to send the right messages to our children  a strong america must also value the institution of marriage i believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental enduring institutions of our civilization congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the defense of marriage act signed in 1996 by president clinton that statute protects marriage under federal law as a union of a man and a woman and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states  activist judges however have begun redefining marriage by court order without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives on an issue of such great consequence the peoples voice must be heard if judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage applause  the outcome of this debate is important  and so is the way we conduct it the same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in gods sight applause  its also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion of americas religious institutions religious charities of every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country  mentoring children feeding the hungry taking the hand of the lonely yet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups just because they have a cross or a star of david or a crescent on the wall by executive order i have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that includes faithbased charities tonight i ask you to codify this into law so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again applause  in the past weve worked together to bring mentors to children of prisoners and provide treatment for the addicted and help for the homeless tonight i ask you to consider another group of americans in need of help this year some 600000 inmates will be released from prison back into society we know from long experience that if they cant find work or a home or help they are much more likely to commit crime and return to prison so tonight i propose a fouryear 300 million prisoner reentry initiative to expand job training and placement services to provide transitional housing and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring including from faithbased groups applause america is the land of second chance and when the gates of the prison open the path ahead should lead to a better life applause  for all americans the last three years have brought tests we did not ask for and achievements shared by all by our actions we have shown what kind of nation we are in grief we have found the grace to go on in challenge we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people in victory we have shown the noble aims and good heart of america and having come this far we sense that we live in a time set apart  ive been witness to the character of the people of america who have shown calm in times of danger compassion for one another and toughness for the long haul all of us have been partners in a great enterprise and even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic times last month a girl in lincoln rhode island sent me a letter it began dear george w bush if theres anything you know i ashley pearson age 10 can do to help anyone please send me a letter and tell me what i can do to save our country she added this ps if you can send a letter to the troops please put ashley pearson believes in you applause  tonight ashley your message to our troops has just been conveyed and yes you have some duties yourself study hard in school listen to your mom or dad help someone in need and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform say thank you applause and ashley while you do your part all of us here in this great chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of america safe and free applause  my fellow citizens we now move forward with confidence and faith our nation is strong and steadfast the cause we serve is right because it is the cause of all mankind the momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable  and it is not carried forward by our power alone we can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years and in all that is to come we can know that his purposes are just and true  may god continue to bless america applause  
212, State of the Union Address, George W. Bush,2005-02-02,  mr speaker vice president cheney members of congress fellow citizens  as a new congress gathers all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege weve been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve and tonight that is a privilege we share with newlyelected leaders of afghanistan the palestinian territories ukraine and a free and sovereign iraq applause  two weeks ago i stood on the steps of this capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all this evening i will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world  tonight with a healthy growing economy with more americans going back to work with our nation an active force for good in the world  the state of our union is confident and strong applause  our generation has been blessed  by the expansion of opportunity by advances in medicine by the security purchased by our parents sacrifice now as we see a little gray in the mirror  or a lot of gray  laughter  and we watch our children moving into adulthood we ask the question what will be the state of their union members of congress the choices we make together will answer that question over the next several months on issue after issue let us do what americans have always done and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren applause  first we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely americas economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation in the past four years we provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes overcome a recession opened up new markets abroad prosecuted corporate criminals raised homeownership to its highest level in history and in the last year alone the united states has added 23 million new jobs applause when action was needed the congress delivered  and the nation is grateful  now we must add to these achievements by making our economy more flexible more innovative and more competitive we will keep america the economic leader of the world applause  americas prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government i welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline i will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation makes tax relief permanent and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009 applause my budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results or duplicate current efforts or do not fulfill essential priorities the principle here is clear taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely or not at all applause  to make our economy stronger and more dynamic we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century under the no child left behind act standards are higher test scores are on the rise and were closing the achievement gap for minority students now we must demand better results from our high schools so every high school diploma is a ticket to success we will help an additional 200000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job training system and strengthening americas community colleges and well make it easier for americans to afford a college education by increasing the size of pell grants applause  to make our economy stronger and more competitive america must reward not punish the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs small business is the path of advancement especially for women and minorities so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest jobcreators from junk lawsuits applause justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsible classactions and frivolous asbestos claims  and i urge congress to pass legal reforms this year applause  to make our economy stronger and more productive we must make health care more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage  applause  and more control over their health decisions applause i ask congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help lowincome workers buy insurance a community health center in every poor country improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs association health plans for small businesses and their employees  applause  expanded health savings accounts  applause  and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need applause  to keep our economy growing we also need reliable supplies of affordable environmentally responsible energy applause nearly four years ago i submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation alternative sources a modernized electricity grid and more production here at home  including safe clean nuclear energy applause my clear skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens applause and my budget provides strong funding for leadingedge technology  from hydrogenfueled cars to clean coal to renewable sources such as ethanol applause four years of debate is enough i urge congress to pass legislation that makes america more secure and less dependent on foreign energy applause  all these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs  but they are just the beginning of our duty to build the prosperity of future generations we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time year after year americans are burdened by an archaic incoherent federal tax code ive appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom and when their recommendations are delivered you and i will work together to give this nation a tax code that is progrowth easy to understand and fair to all applause  americas immigration system is also outdated  unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country we should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families and deny businesses willing workers and invite chaos at our border it is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs americans will not take that rejects amnesty that tells us who is entering and leaving our country and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists applause  one of americas most important institutions  a symbol of the trust between generations  is also in need of wise and effective reform social security was a great moral success of the 20th century and we must honor its great purposes in this new century applause the system however on its current path is headed toward bankruptcy and so we must join together to strengthen and save social security applause  today more than 45 million americans receive social security benefits and millions more are nearing retirement  and for them the system is sound and fiscally strong i have a message for every american who is 55 or older do not let anyone mislead you for you the social security system will not change in any way applause for younger workers the social security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time social security was created decades ago for a very different era in those days people did not live as long benefits were much lower than they are today and a halfcentury ago about sixteen workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits  our society has changed in ways the founders of social security could not have foreseen in todays world people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer and those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades and instead of sixteen workers paying in for every beneficiary right now its only about three workers and over the next few decades that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary with each passing year fewer workers are paying everhigher benefits to an everlarger number of retirees  so here is the result thirteen years from now in 2018 social security will be paying out more than it takes in and every year afterward will bring a new shortfall bigger than the year before for example in the year 2027 the government will somehow have to come up with an extra 200 billion to keep the system afloat  and by 2033 the annual shortfall would be more than 300 billion by the year 2042 the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt if steps are not taken to avert that outcome the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes massive new borrowing or sudden and severe cuts in social security benefits or other government programs  i recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off but those dates are not so distant as any parent will tell you if you have a fiveyearold youre already concerned about how youll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road if youve got children in their 20s as some of us do the idea of social security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter and it should not be a small matter to the united states congress applause you and i share a responsibility we must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of social security once and for all  fixing social security permanently will require an open candid review of the options some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees former congressman tim penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages during the 1990s my predecessor president clinton spoke of increasing the retirement age former senator john breaux suggested discouraging early collection of social security benefits the late senator daniel patrick moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated all these ideas are on the table  i know that none of these reforms would be easy but we have to move ahead with courage and honesty because our childrens retirement security is more important than partisan politics applause i will work with members of congress to find the most effective combination of reforms i will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer applause we must however be guided by some basic principles we must make social security permanently sound not leave that task for another day we must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes we must ensure that lowerincome americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement we must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement and we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future  as we fix social security we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers and the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts applause here is how the idea works right now a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the social security benefits of todays retirees if youre a younger worker i believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account so you can build a nest egg for your own future  heres why the personal accounts are a better deal your money will grow over time at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver  and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from social security in addition youll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account if you wish to your children and  or grandchildren and best of all the money in the account is yours and the government can never take it away applause  the goal here is greater security in retirement so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts well make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds well make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden wall street fees well make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement well make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once but rather paid out over time as an addition to traditional social security benefits and well make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time eventually permitting all workers to set aside four percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts  personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees because you already have something similar called the thrift savings plan which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadlybased investment funds its time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young americans applause  our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society so many of my generation after a long journey have come home to family and faith and are determined to bring up responsible moral children government is not the source of these values but government should never undermine them  because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society it should not be redefined by activist judges for the good of families children and society i support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage applause  because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable we must strive to build a culture of life medical research can help us reach that goal by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities  and i thank the congress for doubling the funding of the national institutes of health applause to build a culture of life we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others we should all be able to agree  applause  we should all be able to agree on some clear standards i will work with congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity applause america will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious aggressive and always ethical  because courts must always deliver impartial justice judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law not legislate from the bench applause as president i have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are wellqualified to serve on the bench  and i have done so applause the constitution also gives the senate a responsibility every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote applause  because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of america our government will continue to support faithbased and community groups that bring hope to harsh places now we need to focus on giving young people especially young men in our cities better options than apathy or gangs or jail tonight i propose a threeyear initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence applause taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to atrisk youth which involves parents and pastors coaches and community leaders in programs ranging from literacy to sports and i am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our first lady laura bush applause  because hivaids brings suffering and fear into so many lives i ask you to reauthorize the ryan white act to encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease applause and as we update this important law we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases african american men and women applause  because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice we need to make sure americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice in america we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit  so we are dramatically expanding the use of dna evidence to prevent wrongful conviction applause soon i will send to congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side applause  our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an america that is safe from danger and protected by peace we will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy  and chief among them is freedom from fear  in the three and a half years since september the 11th 2001 we have taken unprecedented actions to protect americans weve created a new department of government to defend our homeland focused the fbi on preventing terrorism begun to reform our intelligence agencies broken up terror cells across the country expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack improved border security and trained more than a halfmillion first responders police and firefighters air marshals researchers and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer and we thank them all applause  our nation working with allies and friends has also confronted the enemy abroad with measures that are determined successful and continuing the al qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders  but many of its top commanders have been removed there are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists  but their number has declined there are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction  but no longer without attention and without consequence our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many and intimidate us all  and we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won applause  pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror  and i thank the congress for providing our servicemen and women with the resources they have needed during this time of war we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory applause  other nations around the globe have stood with us in afghanistan an international force is helping provide security in iraq 28 countries have troops on the ground the united nations and the european union provided technical assistance for the elections and nato is leading a mission to help train iraqi officers were cooperating with 60 governments in the proliferation security initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials were working closely with the governments in asia to convince north korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions pakistan saudi arabia and nine other countries have captured or detained al qaeda terrorists in the next four years my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time applause  in the longterm the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder if whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred they will be the recruiting grounds for terror and that terror will stalk america and other free nations for decades the only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force of human freedom applause our enemies know this and that is why the terrorist zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the evil principle of democracy and weve declared our own intention america will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the middle east and beyond with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world applause  the united states has no right no desire and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else that is one of the main differences between us and our enemies they seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression in which a tiny group of brutal selfappointed rulers control every aspect of every life our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their own cultures and because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors the advance of freedom will lead to peace applause  that advance has great momentum in our time  shown by women voting in afghanistan and palestinians choosing a new direction and the people of ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president we are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty and in the coming years we will add to that story applause  the beginnings of reform and democracy in the palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure tomorrow morning secretary of state rice departs on a trip that will take her to israel and the west bank for meetings with prime minister sharon and president abbas she will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful independent democratic state to promote this democracy i will ask congress for 350 million to support palestinian political economic and security reforms the goal of two democratic states israel and palestine living side by side in peace is within reach  and america will help them achieve that goal applause  to promote peace and stability in the broader middle east the united states will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror while we encourage a higher standard of freedom hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from morocco to jordan to bahrain the government of saudi arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future and the great and proud nation of egypt which showed the way toward peace in the middle east can now show the way toward democracy in the middle east applause  to promote peace in the broader middle east we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder syria still allows its territory and parts of lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region you have passed and we are applying the syrian accountability act  and we expect the syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom applause today iran remains the worlds primary state sponsor of terror  pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve we are working with european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror and to the iranian people i say tonight as you stand for your own liberty america stands with you applause  our generational commitment to the advance of freedom especially in the middle east is now being tested and honored in iraq that country is a vital front in the war on terror which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in iraq so we do not have to face them here at home applause and the victory of freedom in iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror inspire democratic reformers from damascus to tehran bring more hope and progress to a troubled region and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren  we will succeed because the iraqi people value their own liberty  as they showed the world last sunday applause across iraq often at great risk millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new transitional national assembly a young woman in baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote she said hearing those explosions it occurred to me  the insurgents are weak they are afraid of democracy they are losing so i got my husband and i got my parents and we all came out and voted together  americans recognize that spirit of liberty because we share it in any nation casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility for millions of iraqis it was also an act of personal courage and they have earned the respect of us all applause  one of iraqs leading democracy and human rights advocates is safia taleb alsuhail she says of her country we were occupied for 35 years by saddam hussein that was the real occupation thank you to the american people who paid the cost but most of all to the soldiers eleven years ago safias father was assassinated by saddams intelligence service three days ago in baghdad safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country  and we are honored that she is with us tonight applause  the terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and will continue to attack it yet the terrorists most powerful myth is being destroyed the whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces they are trying to destroy the hopes of iraqis expressed in free elections and the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the iraqi people applause  we will succeed in iraq because iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own history as prime minister allawi said in his speech to congress last september ordinary iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible that is the natural desire of an independent nation and it is also the stated mission of our coalition in iraq the new political situation in iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country  at the recommendation of our commanders on the ground and in consultation with the iraqi government we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable iraqi security forces  forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure as those forces become more selfreliant and take on greater security responsibilities america and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role in the end iraqis must be able to defend their own country  and we will help that proud new nation secure its liberty  recently an iraqi interpreter said to a reporter tell america not to abandon us he and all iraqis can be certain while our military strategy is adapting to circumstances our commitment remains firm and unchanging we are standing for the freedom of our iraqi friends and freedom in iraq will make america safer for generations to come applause we will not set an artificial timetable for leaving iraq because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out we are in iraq to achieve a result a country that is democratic representative of all its people at peace with its neighbors and able to defend itself and when that result is achieved our men and women serving in iraq will return home with the honor they have earned applause  right now americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world often taking great risks on my orders we have given them training and equipment and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every american proud applause the volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle unwavering in loyalty unmatched in honor and decency and every day theyre making our nation more secure some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries and this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover applause and we have said farewell to some very good men and women who died for our freedom and whose memory this nation will honor forever  one name we honor is marine corps sergeant byron norwood of pflugerville texas who was killed during the assault on fallujah his mom janet sent me a letter and told me how much byron loved being a marine and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror she wrote when byron was home the last time i said that i wanted to protect him like i had since he was born he just hugged me and said youve done your job mom now it is my turn to protect you ladies and gentlemen with grateful hearts we honor freedoms defenders and our military families represented here this evening by sergeant norwoods mom and dad janet and bill norwood applause  in these four years americans have seen the unfolding of large events we have known times of sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory in all this history even when we have disagreed we have seen threads of purpose that unite us the attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedoms power to change the world we are all part of a great venture to extend the promise of freedom in our country to renew the values that sustain our liberty and to spread the peace that freedom brings  as franklin roosevelt once reminded americans each age is a dream that is dying or one that is coming to birth and we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born the abolition of slavery was only a dream  until it was fulfilled the liberation of europe from fascism was only a dream  until it was achieved the fall of imperial communism was only a dream  until one day it was accomplished our generation has dreams of its own and we also go forward with confidence the road of providence is uneven and unpredictable  yet we know where it leads it leads to freedom  thank you and may god bless america applause  
213, State of the Union Address, George W. Bush,2006-01-31,  thank you all mr speaker vice president cheney members of congress members of the supreme court and diplomatic corps distinguished guests and fellow citizens today our nation lost a beloved graceful courageous woman who called america to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken so long ago and we are grateful for the good life of coretta scott king applause  every time im invited to this rostrum im humbled by the privilege and mindful of the history weve seen together we have gathered under this capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement we have served america through one of the most consequential periods of our history  and it has been my honor to serve with you  in a system of two parties two chambers and two elected branches there will always be differences and debate but even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger to confront the great issues before us we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another  and i will do my part tonight the state of our union is strong  and together we will make it stronger applause  in this decisive year you and i will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country we will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom  or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life we will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy  or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity in a complex and challenging time the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting  yet it ends in danger and decline the only way to protect our people the only way to secure the peace the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership  so the united states of america will continue to lead applause  abroad our nation is committed to an historic longterm goal  we seek the end of tyranny in our world some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism in reality the future security of america depends on it on september the 11th 2001 we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country dictatorships shelter terrorists and feed resentment and radicalism and seek weapons of mass destruction democracies replace resentment with hope respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors and join the fight against terror every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer  so we will act boldly in freedoms cause applause  far from being a hopeless dream the advance of freedom is the great story of our time in 1945 there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world today there are 122 and were writing a new chapter in the story of selfgovernment  with women lining up to vote in afghanistan and millions of iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink and men and women from lebanon to egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom at the start of 2006 more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations and we do not forget the other half  in places like syria and burma zimbabwe north korea and iran  because the demands of justice and the peace of this world require their freedom as well applause  no one can deny the success of freedom but some men rage and fight against it and one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical islam  the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death terrorists like bin laden are serious about mass murder  and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously they seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the middle east and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder  their aim is to seize power in iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against america and the world lacking the military strength to challenge us directly the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear when they murder children at a school in beslan or blow up commuters in london or behead a bound captive the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will allowing the violent to inherit the earth but they have miscalculated we love our freedom and we will fight to keep it applause  in a time of testing we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders if we were to leave these vicious attackers alone they would not leave us alone they would simply move the battlefield to our own shores there is no peace in retreat and there is no honor in retreat by allowing radical islam to work its will  by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself  we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals or even in our own courage but our enemies and our friends can be certain the united states will not retreat from the world and we will never surrender to evil applause  america rejects the false comfort of isolationism we are the nation that saved liberty in europe and liberated death camps and helped raise up democracies and faced down an evil empire once again we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace we remain on the offensive against terror networks we have killed or captured many of their leaders  and for the others their day will come  we remain on the offensive in afghanistan where a fine president and a national assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy were on the offensive in iraq with a clear plan for victory first were helping iraqis build an inclusive government so that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized  second were continuing reconstruction efforts and helping the iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy so all iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom and third were striking terrorist targets while we train iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy iraqis are showing their courage every day and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom applause  our work in iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal but that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy in less than three years the nation has gone from dictatorship to liberation to sovereignty to a constitution to national elections at the same time our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration clearing out insurgent strongholds and turning over territory to iraqi security forces i am confident in our plan for victory i am confident in the will of the iraqi people i am confident in the skill and spirit of our military fellow citizens we are in this fight to win and we are winning applause  the road of victory is the road that will take our troops home as we make progress on the ground and iraqi forces increasingly take the lead we should be able to further decrease our troop levels  but those decisions will be made by our military commanders not by politicians in washington dc applause  our coalition has learned from our experience in iraq weve adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction along the way we have benefitted from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of congress of both parties in the coming year i will continue to reach out and seek your good advice yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure applause hindsight alone is not wisdom and secondguessing is not a strategy applause  with so much in the balance those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor a sudden withdrawal of our forces from iraq would abandon our iraqi allies to death and prison would put men like bin laden and zarqawi in charge of a strategic country and show that a pledge from america means little members of congress however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past our nation has only one option we must keep our word defeat our enemies and stand behind the american military in this vital mission applause  our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices  and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear they know what its like to fight house to house in a maze of streets to wear heavy gear in the desert heat to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb and those who know the costs also know the stakes marine staff sergeant dan clay was killed last month fighting in fallujah he left behind a letter to his family but his words could just as well be addressed to every american here is what dan wrote i know what honor is   it has been an honor to protect and serve all of you i faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to  never falter dont hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting  staff sergeant dan clays wife lisa and his mom and dad sara jo and bud are with us this evening welcome applause  our nation is grateful to the fallen who live in the memory of our country were grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nations uniform  and as we honor our brave troops let us never forget the sacrifices of americas military families applause  our offensive against terror involves more than military action ultimately the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change so the united states of america supports democratic reform across the broader middle east elections are vital but they are only the beginning raising up a democracy requires the rule of law and protection of minorities and strong accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote  the great people of egypt have voted in a multiparty presidential election  and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism the palestinian people have voted in elections and now the leaders of hamas must recognize israel disarm reject terrorism and work for lasting peace applause saudi arabia has taken the first steps of reform  now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts democracies in the middle east will not look like our own because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens yet liberty is the future of every nation in the middle east because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity applause  the same is true of iran a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people the regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the palestinian territories and in lebanon  and that must come to an end applause the iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions and the nations of the world must not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons applause america will continue to rally the world to confront these threats  tonight let me speak directly to the citizens of iran america respects you and we respect your country we respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom and our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic iran applause  to overcome dangers in our world we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress and fighting disease and spreading hope in hopeless lands isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need we show compassion abroad because americans believe in the godgiven dignity and worth of a villager with hivaids or an infant with malaria or a refugee fleeing genocide or a young girl sold into slavery we also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty corruption and despair are sources of terrorism and organized crime and human trafficking and the drug trade  in recent years you and i have taken unprecedented action to fight aids and malaria expand the education of girls and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform for people everywhere the united states is a partner for a better life shortchanging these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world undercut our longterm security and dull the conscience of our country i urge members of congress to serve the interests of america by showing the compassion of america  our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home the enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us fortunately this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement intelligence the military and homeland security these men and women are dedicating their lives protecting us all and they deserve our support and our thanks applause they also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime  so i ask you to reauthorize the patriot act applause  it is said that prior to the attacks of september the 11th our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy we now know that two of the hijackers in the united states placed telephone calls to al qaeda operatives overseas but we did not know about their plans until it was too late so to prevent another attack   based on authority given to me by the constitution and by statute  i have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from america previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority i have and federal courts have approved the use of that authority appropriate members of congress have been kept informed the terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks it remains essential to the security of america if there are people inside our country who are talking with al qaeda we want to know about it because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again applause  in all these areas  from the disruption of terror networks to victory in iraq to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions  we need the support of our friends and allies to draw that support we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act the only alternative to american leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth american leaders  from roosevelt to truman to kennedy to reagan  rejected isolation and retreat because they knew that america is always more secure when freedom is on the march  our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy  a war that will be fought by presidents of both parties who will need steady bipartisan support from the congress and tonight i ask for yours together let us protect our country support the men and women who defend us and lead this world toward freedom applause  here at home america also has a great opportunity we will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world   our economy is healthy and vigorous and growing faster than other major industrialized nations in the last twoandahalf years america has created 46 million new jobs  more than japan and the european union combined applause even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters the american people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world  the american economy is preeminent but we cannot afford to be complacent in a dynamic world economy we are seeing new competitors like china and india and this creates uncertainty which makes it easier to feed peoples fears so were seeing some old temptations return protectionists want to escape competition pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy centralizing more power in washington and increasing taxes we hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy  even though this economy could not function without them applause all these are forms of economic retreat and they lead in the same direction  toward a stagnant and secondrate economy   tonight i will set out a better path an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs americans should not fear our economic future because we intend to shape it  keeping america competitive begins with keeping our economy growing and our economy grows when americans have more of their own money to spend save and invest in the last five years the tax relief you passed has left 880 billion in the hands of american workers investors small businesses and families  and they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth applause yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years if we do nothing american families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome  because america needs more than a temporary expansion we need more than temporary tax relief i urge the congress to act responsibly and make the tax cuts permanent applause  keeping america competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars every year of my presidency weve reduced the growth of nonsecurity discretionary spending and last year you passed bills that cut this spending this year my budget will cut it again and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities by passing these reforms we will save the american taxpayer another 14 billion next year and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009 applause  i am pleased that members of congress are working on earmark reform because the federal budget has too many special interest projects applause and we can tackle this problem together if you pass the lineitem veto applause  we must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending or entitlements this year the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60 including two of my dads favorite people  me and president clinton laughter this milestone is more than a personal crisis  laughter  it is a national challenge the retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government by 2030 spending for social security medicare and medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget and that will present future congresses with impossible choices  staggering tax increases immense deficits or deep cuts in every category of spending  congress did not act last year on my proposal to save social security  applause  yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away applause and every year we fail to act the situation gets worse  so tonight i ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on social security medicare and medicaid this commission should include members of congress of both parties and offer bipartisan solutions we need to put aside partisan politics and work together and get this problem solved applause  keeping america competitive requires us to open more markets for all that americans make and grow one out of every five factory jobs in america is related to global trade and we want people everywhere to buy american with open markets and a level playing field no one can outproduce or outcompete the american worker applause  keeping america competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws reflects our values and serves the interests of our economy our nation needs orderly and secure borders applause to meet this goal we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection applause and we must have a rational humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally and reduces smuggling and crime at the border applause  keeping america competitive requires affordable health care applause our government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly and we are meeting that responsibility applause for all americans  for all americans we must confront the rising cost of care strengthen the doctorpatient relationship and help people afford the insurance coverage they need applause  we will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors we will strengthen health savings accounts  making sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get applause we will do more to make this coverage portable so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance applause and because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice  leaving women in nearly 1500 american counties without a single obgyn  i ask the congress to pass medical liability reform this year applause  keeping america competitive requires affordable energy and here we have a serious problem america is addicted to oil which is often imported from unstable parts of the world the best way to break this addiction is through technology since 2001 we have spent nearly 10 billion to develop cleaner cheaper and more reliable alternative energy sources  and we are on the threshold of incredible advances  so tonight i announce the advanced energy initiative  a 22percent increase in cleanenergy research  at the department of energy to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas to change how we power our homes and offices we will invest more in zeroemission coalfired plants revolutionary solar and wind technologies and clean safe nuclear energy applause  we must also change how we power our automobiles we will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars and in pollutionfree cars that run on hydrogen well also fund additional research in cuttingedge methods of producing ethanol not just from corn but from wood chips and stalks or switch grass our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years applause  breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the middle east by 2025 applause by applying the talent and technology of america this country can dramatically improve our environment move beyond a petroleumbased economy and make our dependence on middle eastern oil a thing of the past applause  and to keep america competitive one commitment is necessary above all we must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated hardworking ambitious people  and were going to keep that edge tonight i announce an american competitiveness initiative to encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our nations children a firm grounding in math and science applause  first i propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years this funding will support the work of americas most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology supercomputing and alternative energy sources  second i propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit  applause  to encourage bolder privatesector initiatives in technology with more research in both the public and private sectors we will improve our quality of life  and ensure that america will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come applause  third we need to encourage children to take more math and science and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations weve made a good start in the early grades with the no child left behind act which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country tonight i propose to train 70000 high school teachers to lead advancedplacement courses in math and science bring 30000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms and give early help to students who struggle with math so they have a better chance at good highwage jobs if we ensure that americas children succeed in life they will ensure that america succeeds in the world applause  preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share i urge you to support the american competitiveness initiative and together we will show the world what the american people can achieve  america is a great force for freedom and prosperity yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries but by who we are and how we treat one another so we strive to be a compassionate decent hopeful society  in recent years america has become a more hopeful nation violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade drug use among youth is down 19 percent since 2001 there are fewer abortions in america than at any point in the last three decades and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row applause  these gains are evidence of a quiet transformation  a revolution of conscience in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment government has played a role wise policies such as welfare reform and drug education and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country and everyone here tonight democrat and republican has a right to be proud of this record applause  yet many americans especially parents still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture and the health of our most basic institutions theyre concerned about unethical conduct by public officials and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage they worry about children in our society who need direction and love and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster and about suffering caused by treatable diseases  as we look at these challenges we must never give in to the belief that america is in decline or that our culture is doomed to unravel the american people know better than that we have proven the pessimists wrong before  and we will do it again applause  a hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the law the supreme court now has two superb new members  new members on its bench chief justice john roberts and justice sam alito applause i thank the senate for confirming both of them i will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law and not legislate from the bench applause  today marks the official retirement of a very special american for 24 years of faithful service to our nation the united states is grateful to justice sandra day oconnor applause  a hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life tonight i ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research human cloning in all its forms creating or implanting embryos for experiments creating humananimal hybrids and buying selling or patenting human embryos human life is a gift from our creator  and that gift should never be discarded devalued or put up for sale applause  a hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust applause honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of washington  i support your efforts each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility  and that is a pledge we must never forget never dismiss and never betray applause  as we renew the promise of our institutions let us also show the character of america in our compassion and care for one another  a hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love through the helping americas youth initiative we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child  and this good work is being led by our first lady laura bush applause this year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school so more of americas youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams  a hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency  and stays at it until theyre back on their feet so far the federal government has committed 85 billion to the people of the gulf coast and new orleans were removing debris and repairing highways and rebuilding stronger levees were providing business loans and housing assistance yet as we meet these immediate needs we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived  in new orleans and in other places many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country the answer is not only temporary relief but schools that teach every child and job skills that bring upward mobility and more opportunities to own a home and start a business as we recover from a disaster let us also work for the day when all americans are protected by justice equal in hope and rich in opportunity applause  a hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like hivaids which can be prevented and treated and defeated more than a million americans live with hiv and half of all aids cases occur among african americans i ask congress to reform and reauthorize the ryan white act and provide new funding to states so we end the waiting lists for aids medicines in america applause we will also lead a nationwide effort working closely with african american churches and faithbased groups to deliver rapid hiv tests to millions end the stigma of aids and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in america applause  fellow citizens weve been called to leadership in a period of consequence weve entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite we see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc toward an unknown shore yet the destination of history is determined by human action and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing  lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery martin luther king could have stopped at birmingham or at selma and achieved only half a victory over segregation the united states could have accepted the permanent division of europe and been complicit in the oppression of others today having come far in our own historical journey we must decide will we turn back or finish well  before history is written down in books it is written in courage like americans before us we will show that courage and we will finish well we will lead freedoms advance we will compete and excel in the global economy we will renew the defining moral commitments of this land and so we move forward  optimistic about our country faithful to its cause and confident of the victories to come  may god bless america applause  
214, State of the Union Address, George W. Bush,2007-01-23,  thank you very much and tonight i have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own  as the first president to begin the state of the union message with these words madam speaker applause  in his day the late congressman thomas dalesandro jr from baltimore maryland saw presidents roosevelt and truman at this rostrum but nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter nancy presiding tonight as speaker of the house of representatives applause congratulations madam speaker applause  two members of the house and senate are not with us tonight and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of senator tim johnson and congressman charlie norwood applause  madam speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished guests and fellow citizens  the rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour  when decisions are hard and courage is needed we enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway and others that are ours to begin in all of this much is asked of us we must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies  and the wisdom to face them together  some in this chamber are new to the house and the senate  and i congratulate the democrat majority applause congress has changed but not our responsibilities each of us is guided by our own convictions  and to these we must stay faithful yet were all held to the same standards and called to serve the same good purposes to extend this nations prosperity to spend the peoples money wisely to solve problems not leave them to future generations to guard america against all evil and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us applause  were not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air like many before us we can work through our differences and achieve big things for the american people our citizens dont much care which side of the aisle we sit on  as long as were willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done applause our job is to make life better for our fellow americans and to help them to build a future of hope and opportunity  and this is the business before us tonight  a future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy  and that is what we have were now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth in a recovery that has created 72 million new jobs  so far unemployment is low inflation is low and wages are rising this economy is on the move and our job is to keep it that way not with more government but with more enterprise applause  next week ill deliver a full report on the state of our economy tonight i want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this congress  first we must balance the federal budget applause we can do so without raising taxes applause what we need is impose spending discipline in washington dc we set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 and met that goal three years ahead of schedule applause now let us take the next step in the coming weeks i will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years applause i ask you to make the same commitment together we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal government and we can balance the federal budget applause  next there is the matter of earmarks these special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour  when not even cspan is watching laughter in 2005 alone the number of earmarks grew to over 13000 and totaled nearly 18 billion even worse over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the house and senate  they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk you didnt vote them into law i didnt sign them into law yet theyre treated as if they have the force of law the time has come to end this practice so let us work together to reform the budget process expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in congress and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session applause  and finally to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements social security and medicare and medicaid are commitments of conscience and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound yet were failing in that duty and this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options huge tax increases huge deficits or huge and immediate cuts in benefits everyone in this chamber knows this to be true  yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act so let us work together and do it now with enough good sense and goodwill you and i can fix medicare and medicaid  and save social security applause  spreading opportunity and hope in america also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life five years ago we rose above partisan differences to pass the no child left behind act preserving local control raising standards and holding those schools accountable for results and because we acted students are performing better in reading and math and minority students are closing the achievement gap  now the task is to build on the success without watering down standards without taking control from local communities and without backsliding and calling it reform we can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better applause we must increase funds for students who struggle  and make sure these children get the special help they need applause and we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills the no child left behind act has worked for americas children  and i ask congress to reauthorize this good law applause  a future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care applause when it comes to health care government has an obligation to care for the elderly the disabled and poor children and we will meet those responsibilities for all other americans private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs applause but many americans cannot afford a health insurance policy  and so tonight i propose two new initiatives to help more americans afford their own insurance first i propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax  or payroll taxes on 15000 of their income single americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on 7500 of their income with this reform more than 100 million men women and children who are now covered by employerprovided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills at the same time this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job for americans who now purchase health insurance on their own this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings  4500 for a family of four making 60000 a year and for the millions of other americans who have no health insurance at all this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more americans applause  my second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured states that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick i have asked the secretary of health and human services to work with congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create affordable choices grants these grants would give our nations governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need  there are many other ways that congress can help we need to expand health savings accounts applause we need to help small businesses through association health plans applause we need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology applause we will encourage price transparency and to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits we passing medical liability reform applause in all we do we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by government and insurance companies but by patients and their doctors applause  extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of america  with laws that are fair and borders that are secure when laws and borders are routinely violated this harms the interests of our country to secure our border were doubling the size of the border patrol and funding new infrastructure and technology  yet even with all these steps we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border  and that requires a temporary worker program we should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis as a result they wont have to try to sneak in and that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists applause well enforce our immigration laws at the work site and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers so theres no excuse left for violating the law applause  we need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals applause we need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty applause convictions run deep in this capitol when it comes to immigration let us have a serious civil and conclusive debate so that you can pass and i can sign comprehensive immigration reform into law applause  extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps americas economy running and americas environment clean for too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil and this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists  who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments and raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy  its in our vital interest to diversify americas energy supply  the way forward is through technology we must continue changing the way america generates electric power by even greater use of clean coal technology solar and wind energy and clean safe nuclear power applause we need to press on with battery research for plugin and hybrid vehicles and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel applause we must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol  applause  using everything from wood chips to grasses to agricultural wastes  we made a lot of progress thanks to good policies here in washington and the strong response of the market and now even more dramatic advances are within reach tonight i ask congress to join me in pursuing a great goal let us build on the work weve done and reduce gasoline usage in the united states by 20 percent in the next 10 years applause when we do that we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of threequarters of all the oil we now import from the middle east  to reach this goal we must increase the supply of alternative fuels by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017  and that is nearly five times the current target applause at the same time we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks  and conserve up to 85 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017  achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil but its not going to eliminate it and so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways applause and to further protect america against severe disruptions to our oil supply i ask congress to double the current capacity of the strategic petroleum reserve applause  america is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil and these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change applause  a future of hope and opportunity requires a fair impartial system of justice the lives of our citizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts we have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings as president i have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench and the united states senate has a duty as well to give those nominees a fair hearing and a prompt upordown vote on the senate floor applause  for all of us in this room there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause weve had time to take stock of our situation weve added many critical protections to guard the homeland we know with certainty that the horrors of that september morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us  unless we stop them  with the distance of time we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions yet one question has surely been settled that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy applause  from the start america and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense the enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary easy movement steady financing and free flowing communications are long over for the terrorists life since 911 has never been the same  our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen we cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented but here is some of what we do know we stopped an al qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast we broke up a southeast asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the united states we uncovered an al qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against america and just last august british authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for america over the atlantic ocean for each life saved we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them applause  every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy the evil that inspired and rejoiced in 911 is still at work in the world and so long as thats the case america is still a nation at war  in the mind of the terrorist this war began well before september the 11th and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled and these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy al qaeda and its followers are sunni extremists possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology take almost any principle of civilization and their goal is the opposite they preach with threats instruct with bullets and bombs and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent  our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions they want to overthrow moderate governments and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country by killing and terrorizing americans they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty they would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology listen to this warning from the late terrorist zarqawi we will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams and what is coming is even worse osama bin laden declared death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us  these men are not given to idle words and they are just one camp in the islamist radical movement in recent times it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from shia extremists who are just as hostile to america and are also determined to dominate the middle east many are known to take direction from the regime in iran which is funding and arming terrorists like hezbollah  a group second only to al qaeda in the american lives it has taken  the shia and sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat whatever slogans they chant when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes they want to kill americans kill democracy in the middle east and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale  in the sixth year since our nation was attacked i wish i could report to you that the dangers had ended they have not and so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence diplomacy law enforcement and military action to do our duty to find these enemies and to protect the american people applause  this war is more than a clash of arms  it is a decisive ideological struggle and the security of our nation is in the balance to prevail we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us what every terrorist fears most is human freedom   societies where men and women make their own choices answer to their own conscience and live by their hopes instead of their resentments free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies  and most will choose a better way when theyre given a chance so we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy the great question of our day is whether america will help men and women in the middle east to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity and i say for the sake of our own security we must applause  in the last two years weve seen the desire for liberty in the broader middle east  and we have been sobered by the enemys fierce reaction in 2005 the world watched as the citizens of lebanon raised the banner of the cedar revolution they drove out the syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections in 2005 the people of afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature and in 2005 the iraqi people held three national elections choosing a transitional government adopting the most progressive democratic constitution in the arab world and then electing a government under that constitution despite endless threats from the killers in their midst nearly 12 million iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget applause  a thinking enemy watched all of these scenes adjusted their tactics and in 2006 they struck back in lebanon assassins took the life of pierre gemayel a prominent participant in the cedar revolution hezbollah terrorists with support from syria and iran sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine lebanons legitimately elected government in afghanistan taliban and al qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging afghan and nato forces in iraq al qaeda and other sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in shia islam  the golden mosque of samarra this atrocity directed at a muslim house of prayer was designed to provoke retaliation from iraqi shia  and it succeeded radical shia elements some of whom receive support from iran formed death squads the result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day  this is not the fight we entered in iraq but it is the fight were in every one of us wishes this war were over and won yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept our friends abandoned and our own security at risk applause ladies and gentlemen on this day at this hour it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle let us find our resolve and turn events toward victory applause  were carrying out a new strategy in iraq  a plan that demands more from iraqs elected government and gives our forces in iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission our goal is a democratic iraq that upholds the rule of law respects the rights of its people provides them security and is an ally in the war on terror  in order to make progress toward this goal the iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital but the iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own so were deploying reinforcements of more than 20000 additional soldiers and marines to iraq the vast majority will go to baghdad where they will help iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods and serve as advisers embedded in iraqi army units with iraqis in the lead our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists insurgents and the roaming death squads and in anbar province where al qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them were sending an additional 4000 united states marines with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out applause we didnt drive al qaeda out of their safe haven in afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free iraq  the people of iraq want to live in peace and now its time for their government to act iraqs leaders know that our commitment is not openended they have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure baghdad  and they must do so they pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party  and they need to follow through and lift needless restrictions on iraqi and coalition forces so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of baghdad iraqs leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks  to achieve reconciliation to share oil revenues among all of iraqs citizens to put the wealth of iraq into the rebuilding of iraq to allow more iraqis to reenter their nations civic life to hold local elections and to take responsibility for security in every iraqi province but for all of this to happen baghdad must be secure and our plan will help the iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments  my fellow citizens our military commanders and i have carefully weighed the options we discussed every possible approach in the end i chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success many in this chamber understand that america must not fail in iraq because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and farreaching  if american forces step back before baghdad is secure the iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides we could expect an epic battle between shia extremists backed by iran and sunni extremists aided by al qaeda and supporters of the old regime a contagion of violence could spill out across the country  and in time the entire region could be drawn into the conflict  for america this is a nightmare scenario for the enemy this is the objective chaos is the greatest ally  their greatest ally in this struggle and out of chaos in iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens new recruits new resources and an even greater determination to harm america to allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of september the 11th and invite tragedy ladies and gentlemen nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for america to succeed in the middle east to succeed in iraq and to spare the american people from this danger applause  this is where matters stand tonight in the here and now i have spoken with many of you in person i respect you and the arguments youve made we went into this largely united in our assumptions and in our convictions and whatever you voted for you did not vote for failure our country is pursuing a new strategy in iraq and i ask you to give it a chance to work and i ask you to support our troops in the field and those on their way applause  the war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and i have turned our duties over to others and thats why its important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through both parties and both branches should work in close consultation its why i propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror made up of leaders in congress from both political parties we will share ideas for how to position america to meet every challenge that confronts us well show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory  and one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the american armed forces are ready for all the challenges ahead applause tonight i ask the congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active army and marine corps by 92000 in the next five years applause a second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps such a corps would function much like our military reserve it would ease the burden on the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when america needs them it would give people across america who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time  americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because were not in this struggle alone we have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism in iraq multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the united nations were working with jordan and saudi arabia and egypt and the gulf states to increase support for iraqs government  the united nations has imposed sanctions on iran and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in tehran to acquire nuclear weapons applause with the other members of the quartet  the un the european union and russia  were pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the holy land and pursuing the establishment of a democratic palestinian state living sidebyside with israel in peace and security applause in afghanistan nato has taken the lead in turning back the taliban and al qaeda offensive  the first time the alliance has deployed forces outside the north atlantic area together with our partners in china japan russia and south korea were pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons applause  we will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like cuba belarus and burma 1  and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of darfur applause  american foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth to whom much is given much is required we hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease  and that is precisely what america is doing we must continue to fight hivaids especially on the continent of africa applause because you funded our emergency plan for aids relief the number of people receiving lifesaving drugs has grown from 50000 to more than 800000 in three short years i ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight hivaids i ask you to provide 12 billion over five years so we can combat malaria in 15 african countries applause  i ask that you fund the millennium challenge account so that american aid reaches the people who need it in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat and let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty applause  when america serves others in this way we show the strength and generosity of our country these deeds reflect the character of our people the greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness courage and selfsacrifice of the american people you see this spirit often if you know where to look  and tonight we need only look above to the gallery  dikembe mutombo grew up in africa amid great poverty and disease he came to georgetown university on a scholarship to study medicine  but coach john thompson got a look at dikembe and had a different idea laughter dikembe became a star in the nba and a citizen of the united states but he never forgot the land of his birth or the duty to share his blessings with others he built a brand new hospital in his old hometown a friend has said of this goodhearted man mutombo believes that god has given him this opportunity to do great things and we are proud to call this son of the congo 2 a citizen of the united states of america applause  after her daughter was born julie aignerclark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child so she borrowed some equipment and began filming childrens videos in her basement the baby einstein company was born and in just five years her business grew to more than 20 million in sales in november 2001 julie sold baby einstein to the walt disney company and with her help baby einstein has grown into a 200 million business julie represents the great enterprising spirit of america and she is using her success to help others  producing child safety videos with john walsh of the national center for missing and exploited children julie says of her new project i believe its the most important thing that i have ever done i believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe and so tonight we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur  julie aignerclark applause  three weeks ago wesley autrey was waiting at a harlem subway station with his two little girls when he saw a man fall into the path of a train with seconds to act wesley jumped onto the tracks pulled the man into the space between the rails and held him as the train passed right above their heads he insists hes not a hero he says we got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms we have got to show each other some love there is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like wesley autrey applause  tommy rieman was a teenager pumping gas in independence kentucky when he enlisted in the united states army in december 2003 he was on a reconnaissance mission in iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire from his humvee sergeant rieman returned fire he used his body as a shield to protect his gunner he was shot in the chest and arm and received shrapnel wounds to his legs  yet he refused medical attention and stayed in the fight he helped to repel a second attack firing grenades at the enemys position for his exceptional courage sergeant rieman was awarded the silver star and like so many other americans who have volunteered to defend us he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country applause  in such courage and compassion ladies and gentlemen we see the spirit and character of america  and these qualities are not in short supply this is a decent and honorable country  and resilient too weve been through a lot together weve met challenges and faced dangers and we know that more lie ahead yet we can go forward with confidence  because the state of our union is strong our cause in the world is right and tonight that cause goes on god bless applause  see you next year thank you for your prayers   
215, State of the Union Address, George W. Bush,2008-01-28,"  the president madam speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished guests and fellow citizens seven years have passed since i first stood before you at this rostrum in that time our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined we faced hard decisions about peace and war rising competition in the world economy and the health and welfare of our citizens these issues call for vigorous debate and i think its fair to say weve answered the call yet history will record that amid our differences we acted with purpose and together we showed the world the power and resilience of american selfgovernment  all of us were sent to washington to carry out the peoples business that is the purpose of this body it is the meaning of our oath it remains our charge to keep  the actions of the 110th congress will affect the security and prosperity of our nation long after this session has ended in this election year let us show our fellow americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them let us show them that republicans and democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time applause  from expanding opportunity to protecting our country weve made good progress yet we have unfinished business before us and the american people expect us to get it done  in the work ahead we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation great as americans we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history we believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens and so in all we do we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions and empower them to improve their lives for their futures  to build a prosperous future we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy as we meet tonight our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty america has added jobs for a record 52 straight months but jobs are now growing at a slower pace wages are up but so are prices for food and gas exports are rising but the housing market has declined at kitchen tables across our country there is a concern about our economic future  in the long run americans can be confident about our economic growth but in the short run we can all see that that growth is slowing so last week my administration reached agreement with speaker pelosi and republican leader boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment the temptation will be to load up the bill that would delay it or derail it and neither option is acceptable applause this is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working and this congress must pass it as soon as possible applause  we have other work to do on taxes unless congress acts most of the tax relief weve delivered over the past seven years will be taken away some in washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase try explaining that to 116 million american taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of 1800 others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes i welcome their enthusiasm im pleased to report that the irs accepts both checks and money orders laughter and applause  most americans think their taxes are high enough with all the other pressures on their finances american families should not have to worry about their federal government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks theres only one way to eliminate this uncertainty make the tax relief permanent applause and members of congress should know if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk i will veto it applause  just as we trust americans with their own money we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely next week ill send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs totaling more than 18 billion the budget that i will submit will keep america on track for a surplus in 2012 american families have to balance their budgets so should their government applause  the peoples trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks  special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute without discussion or debate last year i asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half i also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote unfortunately neither goal was met so this time if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half ill send it back to you with my veto applause  and tomorrow i will issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by congress if these items are truly worth funding congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote applause  our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending on housing we must trust americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market my administration brought together the hope now alliance which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and congress can help even more tonight i ask you to pass legislation to reform fannie mae and freddie mac modernize the federal housing administration and allow state housing agencies to issue taxfree bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages applause these are difficult times for many american families and by taking these steps we can help more of them keep their homes  to build a future of quality health care we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options we share a common goal making health care more affordable and accessible for all americans applause the best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice not government control applause so i have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer this one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions and i call on the congress to pass it this year applause  the congress must also expand health savings accounts create association health plans for small businesses promote health information technology and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits applause with all these steps we will help ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctors office  not in the halls of congress applause  on education we must trust students to learn if given the chance and empower parents to demand results from our schools in neighborhoods across our country there are boys and girls with dreams  and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them  six years ago we came together to pass the no child left behind act and today no one can deny its results last year fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record reading scores are on the rise african american and hispanic students posted alltime highs applause now we must work together to increase accountability add flexibility for states and districts reduce the number of high school dropouts provide extra help for struggling schools  members of congress the no child left behind act is a bipartisan achievement it is succeeding and we owe it to americas children their parents and their teachers to strengthen this good law applause  we must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up thanks to the dc opportunity scholarships you approved more than 2600 of the poorest children in our nations capital have found new hope at a faithbased or other nonpublic school sadly these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of americas inner cities so i will convene a white house summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning and to open the doors of these schools to more children i ask you to support a new 300 million program called pell grants for kids we have seen how pell grants help lowincome college students realize their full potential together weve expanded the size and reach of these grants now let us apply that same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools applause  on trade we must trust american workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas today our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell american goods and crops and services all over the world so were working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can were working for a successful doha round of trade talks and we must complete a good agreement this year at the same time were pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements  i thank the congress for approving a good agreement with peru and now i ask you to approve agreements with colombia and panama and south korea applause many products from these nations now enter america dutyfree yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets these agreements will level the playing field they will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers they will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world those whose products say made in the usa applause  these agreements also promote americas strategic interests the first agreement that will come before you is with colombia a friend of america that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers if we fail to pass this agreement we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere so we must come together pass this agreement and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life applause  trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices yet for some americans trade can mean losing a job and the federal government has a responsibility to help applause i ask congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs applause  to build a future of energy security we must trust in the creative genius of american researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology applause our security our prosperity and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil last year i asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade and you responded together we should take the next steps let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions applause let us increase the use of renewable power and emissionsfree nuclear power applause let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future applause let us create a new international clean technology fund which will help developing nations like india and china make greater use of clean energy sources and let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow stop and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases applause  this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride applause the united states is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change and the best way to meet these goals is for america to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energyefficient technology applause  to keep america competitive into the future we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow last year congress passed legislation supporting the american competitiveness initiative but never followed through with the funding this funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge so i ask congress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure america remains the most dynamic nation on earth applause  on matters of life and science we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries in november we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells this breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life applause  so were expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research and as we explore promising avenues of research we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves and so i call on congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such as the buying selling patenting or cloning of human life applause  on matters of justice we must trust in the wisdom of our founders and empower judges who understand that the constitution means what it says applause ive submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law not the whim of the gavel many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed they are worthy of confirmation and the senate should give each of them a prompt upordown vote applause  in communities across our land we must trust in the good heart of the american people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need over the past seven years more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service americans have volunteered in record numbers charitable donations are higher than ever faithbased groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair with newfound support from the federal government and to help guarantee equal treatment of faithbased organizations when they compete for federal funds i ask you to permanently extend charitable choice applause  tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the gulf coast america honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region we reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before and tonight im pleased to announce that in april we will host this years north american summit of canada mexico and the united states in the great city of new orleans applause  there are two other pressing challenges that ive raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address entitlement spending and immigration every member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like social security medicare and medicaid is growing faster than we can afford we all know the painful choices ahead if america stays on this path massive tax increases sudden and drastic cuts in benefits or crippling deficits ive laid out proposals to reform these programs now i ask members of congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren applause  the other pressing challenge is immigration america needs to secure our borders  and with your help my administration is taking steps to do so were increasing worksite enforcement deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings weve effectively ended the policy of catch and release at the border and by the end of this year we will have doubled the number of border patrol agents yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy applause this will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm we must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally illegal immigration is complicated but it can be resolved and it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals applause  this is the business of our nation here at home yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world  our foreign policy is based on a clear premise we trust that people when given the chance will choose a future of freedom and peace in the last seven years we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty weve seen citizens in georgia and ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections weve seen people in lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence weve seen afghans emerge from the tyranny of the taliban and choose a new president and a new parliament weve seen jubilant iraqis holding up inkstained fingers and celebrating their freedom these images of liberty have inspired us applause  in the past seven years weve also seen images that have sobered us weve watched throngs of mourners in lebanon and pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassins hand weve seen wedding guests in bloodsoaked finery staggering from a hotel in jordan afghans and iraqis blown up in mosques and markets and trains in london and madrid ripped apart by bombs on a clear september day we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant these horrific images serve as a grim reminder the advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists  evil men who despise freedom despise america and aim to subject millions to their violent rule  since 911 we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists we will stay on the offense we will keep up the pressure and we will deliver justice to our enemies applause  we are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century the terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear yet in this war on terror there is one thing we and our enemies agree on in the long run men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny and that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in lebanon iraq afghanistan pakistan and the palestinian territories and that is why for the security of america and the peace of the world we are spreading the hope of freedom applause  in afghanistan america our 25 nato allies and 15 partner nations are helping the afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel a nation that was once a safe haven for al qaeda is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school new roads and hospitals are being built and people are looking to the future with new hope these successes must continue so were adding 3200 marines to our forces in afghanistan where they will fight the terrorists and train the afghan army and police defeating the taliban and al qaeda is critical to our security and i thank the congress for supporting americas vital mission in afghanistan applause  in iraq the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world one year ago our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge iraq into chaos so we reviewed our strategy and changed course we launched a surge of american forces into iraq we gave our troops a new mission work with the iraqi forces to protect the iraqi people pursue the enemy in its strongholds and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country  the iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened those who had worried that america was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of american forces flowing into their country they saw our forces moving into neighborhoods clearing out the terrorists and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return and they saw our troops along with provincial reconstruction teams that include foreign service officers and other skilled public servants coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life our military and civilians in iraq are performing with courage and distinction and they have the gratitude of our whole nation applause  the iraqis launched a surge of their own in the fall of 2006 sunni tribal leaders grew tired of al qaedas brutality and started a popular uprising called the anbar awakening over the past year similar movements have spread across the country and today the grassroots surge includes more than 80000 iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists the government in baghdad has stepped forward as well  adding more than 100000 new iraqi soldiers and police during the past year  while the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains the american and iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago applause when we met last year many said that containing the violence was impossible a year later high profile terrorist attacks are down civilian deaths are down sectarian killings are down  when we met last year militia extremists  some armed and trained by iran  were wreaking havoc in large areas of iraq a year later coalition and iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters and iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country  when we met last year al qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of iraq and their leaders had just offered american forces safe passage out of the country today it is al qaeda that is searching for safe passage they have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held and over the past year weve captured or killed thousands of extremists in iraq including hundreds of key al qaeda leaders and operatives  last month osama bin laden released a tape in which he railed against iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al qaeda and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in iraq ladies and gentlemen some may deny the surge is working but among the terrorists there is no doubt al qaeda is on the run in iraq and this enemy will be defeated applause  when we met last year our troop levels in iraq were on the rise today because of the progress just described we are implementing a policy of return on success and the surge forces we sent to iraq are beginning to come home  this progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders this evening i want to speak directly to our men and women on the front lines soldiers and sailors airmen marines and coast guardsmen in the past year you have done everything weve asked of you and more our nation is grateful for your courage we are proud of your accomplishments and tonight in this hallowed chamber with the american people as our witness we make you a solemn pledge in the fight ahead you will have all you need to protect our nation applause and i ask congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops applause  our enemies in iraq have been hit hard they are not yet defeated and we can still expect tough fighting ahead our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy american troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with iraqi forces and eventually to a protective overwatch mission as part of this transition one army brigade combat team and one marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced in the coming months four additional brigades and two marine battalions will follow suit taken together this means more than 20000 of our troops are coming home applause  any further drawdown of us troops will be based on conditions in iraq and the recommendations of our commanders general petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in the disintegration of the iraqi security forces al qaedairaq regaining lost ground and a marked increase in violence members of congress having come so far and achieved so much we must not allow this to happen applause  in the coming year we will work with iraqi leaders as they build on the progress theyre making toward political reconciliation at the local level sunnis shia and kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives progress in the provinces must be matched by progress in baghdad applause were seeing some encouraging signs the national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces the parliament recently passed both a pension law and debaathification reform theyre now debating a provincial powers law the iraqis still have a distance to travel but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence reconciliation is taking place  and the iraqi people are taking control of their future applause  the mission in iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation but it is in the vital interest of the united states that we succeed a free iraq will deny al qaeda a safe haven a free iraq will show millions across the middle east that a future of liberty is possible a free iraq will be a friend of america a partner in fighting terror and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world  by contrast a failed iraq would embolden the extremists strengthen iran and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends our allies and our homeland the enemy has made its intentions clear at a time when the momentum seemed to favor them al qaidas top commander in iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in washington my fellow americans we will not rest either we will not rest until this enemy has been defeated applause we must do the difficult work today so that years from now people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment prevailed in a tough fight and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer america applause  were also standing against the forces of extremism in the holy land where we have new cause for hope palestinians have elected a president who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with israel israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful democratic palestinian state will be a source of lasting security this month in ramallah and jerusalem i assured leaders from both sides that america will do and i will do everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a palestinian state by the end of this year the time has come for a holy land where a democratic israel and a democratic palestine live sidebyside in peace applause  were also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in tehran irans rulers oppress a good and talented people and wherever freedom advances in the middle east it seems the iranian regime is there to oppose it iran is funding and training militia groups in iraq supporting hezbollah terrorists in lebanon and backing hamas efforts to undermine peace in the holy land tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium which could be used to create a nuclear weapon  our message to the people of iran is clear we have no quarrel with you we respect your traditions and your history we look forward to the day when you have your freedom our message to the leaders of iran is also clear verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiations can begin and to rejoin the community of nations come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions stop your oppression at home cease your support for terror abroad but above all know this america will confront those who threaten our troops we will stand by our allies and we will defend our vital interests in the persian gulf applause  on the home front we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country this is our most solemn duty we are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 911 this is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy in the past six years weve stopped numerous attacks including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in los angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for america over the atlantic dedicated men and women in our government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans these good citizens are saving american lives and everyone in this chamber owes them our thanks applause  and we owe them something more we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe and one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications to protect america we need to know who the terrorists are talking to what they are saying and what theyre planning last year congress passed legislation to help us do that unfortunately congress set the legislation to expire on february the 1st that means if you dont act by friday our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend america weve had ample time for debate the time to act is now applause  protecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military it also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair so america is using its influence to build a freer more hopeful and more compassionate world this is a reflection of our national interest it is the calling of our conscience  america opposes genocide in sudan applause we support freedom in countries from cuba and zimbabwe to belarus and burma applause  america is leading the fight against global poverty with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance weve also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the millennium challenge account this program strengthens democracy transparency and the rule of law in developing nations and i ask you to fully fund this important initiative applause  america is leading the fight against global hunger today more than half the worlds food aid comes from the united states and tonight i ask congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine applause  america is leading the fight against disease with your help were working to cut by half the number of malariarelated deaths in 15 african nations and our emergency plan for aids relief is treating 14 million people we can bring healing and hope to many more so i ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success and i call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting hivaids by approving an additional 30 billion over the next five years applause  america is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people and some of the most compassionate americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us we must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace over the past seven years weve increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent and as we increase funding  applause and as increase funding we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation applause i call on the congress to enact the reforms recommended by senator bob dole and secretary donna shalala so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity applause  our military families also sacrifice for america they endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home we have a responsibility to provide for them so i ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal government and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children applause our military families serve our nation they inspire our nation and tonight our nation honors them applause  the strength  the secret of our strength the miracle of america is that our greatness lies not in our government but in the spirit and determination of our people applause when the federal convention met in philadelphia in 1787 our nation was bound by the articles of confederation which began with the words we the undersigned delegates when gouverneur morris was asked to draft a preamble to our new constitution he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our nation and the history of the world we the people  by trusting the people our founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women by trusting the people succeeding generations transformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful nation on earth and a beacon of hope for millions and so long as we continue to trust the people our nation will prosper our liberty will be secure and the state of our union will remain strong applause  so tonight with confidence in freedoms power and trust in the people let us set forth to do their business god bless america applause 
  "
216, Barack Obama," February 24, 2009",2016-05-12, madam speaker mr vice president members of congress the first lady of the united statesshes around here somewhere i have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great chamber but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here  i know that for many americans watching right now the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others and rightly so if you havent been personally affected by this recession you probably know someone who has a friend a neighbor a member of your family you dont need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis because you live it every day its the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights its the job you thought youd retire from but now have lost the business you built your dreams upon thats now hanging by a thread the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope the impact of this recession is real and it is everywhere  but while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken though we are living through difficult and uncertain times tonight i want every american to know this we will rebuild we will recover and the united states of america will emerge stronger than before  the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation the answers to our problems dont lie beyond our reach they exist in our laboratories and our universities in our fields and our factories in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest working people on earth those qualities that have made america the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure what is required now is for this country to pull together confront boldly the challenges we face and take responsibility for our future once more  now if were honest with ourselves well admit that for too long we have not always met these responsibilities as a government or as a people i say this not to lay blame or to look backwards but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that well be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament  the fact is our economy did not fall into decline overnight nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank we have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy yet we import more oil today than ever before the cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year yet we keep delaying reform our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for and though all these challenges went unsolved we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt both as individuals and through our government than ever before  in other words we have lived through an era where too often shortterm gains were prized over longterm prosperity where we failed to look beyond the next payment the next quarter or the next election a surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market people bought homes they knew they couldnt afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway and all the while critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day well that day of reckoning has arrived and the time to take charge of our future is here  now is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity now is the time to jumpstart job creation restart lending and invest in areas like energy health care and education that will grow our economy even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down that is what my economic agenda is designed to do and that is what id like to talk to you about tonight its an agenda that begins with jobs  as soon as i took office i asked this congress to send me a recovery plan by presidents day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets not because i believe in bigger governmenti dontnot because im not mindful of the massive debt weve inherited i am i called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardship in fact a failure to act would have worsened our longterm deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years and thats why i pushed for quick action and tonight i am grateful that this congress delivered and pleased to say that the american recovery and reinvestment act is now law  over the next 2 years this plan will save or create 35 million jobs more than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges constructing wind turbines and solar panels laying broadband and expanding mass transit  because of this plan there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids health care professionals can continue caring for our sick there are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make because of this plan 95 percent of working households in america will receive a tax cut a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on april 1st because of this plan families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a 2500 tax credit for all 4 years of college and americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm  now i know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work and i understand that skepticism here in washington weve all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending and with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right  and thats why ive asked vice president biden to lead a tough unprecedented oversight effort because nobody messes with joe iam i right they dont mess with him i have told each of my cabinet as well as mayors and governors across the country that they will be held accountable by me and the american people for every dollar they spend ive appointed a proven and aggressive inspector general to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud and we have created a new web site called recoverygov so that every american can find out how and where their money is being spent  so the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track but it is just the first step because even if we manage this plan flawlessly there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system  i want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight because every american should know that it directly affects you and your familys wellbeing you should also know that the money youve deposited in banks across the country is safe your insurance is secure you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system thats not the source of concern the concern is that if we do not restart lending in this country our recovery will be choked off before it even begins  you see the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education how stores stock their shelves farms buy equipment and businesses make payroll  but credit has stopped flowing the way it should too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks and with so much debt and so little confidence these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households to businesses or even to each other and when there is no lending families cant afford to buy homes or cars so businesses are forced to make layoffs our economy suffers even more and credit dries up even further that is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle to restore confidence and restart lending and we will do so in several ways  first we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans college loans and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running  second we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages its a plan that wont help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford but it will help millions of americans who are struggling with declining home values americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped to bring about in fact the average family who refinances today can save nearly 2000 per year on their mortgage  third we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times and when we learn that a major bank has serious problems we will hold accountable those responsible force the necessary adjustments provide the support to clean up their balance sheets and assure the continuity of a strong viable institution that can serve our people and our economy  now i understand that on any given day wall street may be more comforted by an approach that gives bank bailouts with no strings attached and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions but such an approach wont solve the problem and our goal is to quicken the day when we restart lending to the american people and american business and end this crisis once and for all  and i intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive and this time they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the american taxpayer this time ceos wont be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet those days are over  still this plan will require significant resources from the federal governmentand yes probably more than weve already set aside but while the cost of action will be great i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years but perhaps a decade that would be worse for our deficit worse for business worse for you and worse for the next generation and i refuse to let that happen  now i understand that when the last administration asked this congress to provide assistance for struggling banks democrats and republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that followed so were the american taxpayers so was i so i know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions i promise you i get it  but i also know that in a time of crisis we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment my jobour job is to solve the problem our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility i will not sendi will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single wall street executive but i will do whatever it takes to help the small business that cant pay its workers or the family that has saved and still cant get a mortgage thats what this is about its not about helping banks its about helping people applause  its not about helping banks its about helping people because when credit is available again that young family can finally buy a new home and then some company will hire workers to build it and then those workers will have money to spend and if they can get a loan too maybe theyll finally buy that car or open their own business investors will return to the market and american families will see their retirement secured once more slowly but surely confidence will return and our economy will recover  so i ask this congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary because we cannot consign our nation to an openended recession and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again i ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system it is time to put in place tough new commonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation and punishes shortcuts and abuse  the recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps were taking to revive our economy in the short term but the only way to fully restore americas economic strength is to make the longterm investments that will lead to new jobs new industries and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world the only way this century will be another american century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care the schools that arent preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit that is our responsibility  in the next few days i will submit a budget to congress so often weve come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs i see this document differently i see it as a vision for america as a blueprint for our future  my budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue it reflects the stark reality of what weve inherited a trilliondollar deficit a financial crisis and a costly recession given these realities everyone in this chamber democrats and republicans will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars and that includes me but that does not mean we can afford to ignore our longterm challenges i reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity  for history tells a different story history reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation this nation has responded with bold action and big ideas in the midst of civil war we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry from the turmoil of the industrial revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age in the wake of war and depression the gi bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history and a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways an american on the moon and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world in each case government didnt supplant private enterprise it catalyzed private enterprise it created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive  we are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed opportunity from ordeal now we must be that nation again and that is why even as it cuts back on programs we dont need the budget i submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future energy health care and education  it begins with energy we know the country that harnesses the power of clean renewable energy will lead the 21st century and yet it is china that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient we invented solar technology but weve fallen behind countries like germany and japan in producing it new plugin hybrids roll off our assembly lines but they will run on batteries made in korea well i do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders and i know you dont either it is time for america to lead again  thanks to our recovery plan we will double this nations supply of renewable energy in the next 3 years weve also made the largest investment in basic research funding in american history an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy but breakthroughs in medicine and science and technology  we will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country and we will put americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills  but to truly transform our economy to protect our security and save our planet from the ravages of climate change we need to ultimately make clean renewable energy the profitable kind of energy so i ask this congress to send me legislation that places a marketbased cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in america thats what we need and to support that innovation we will invest 15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power advanced biofuels clean coal and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in america  speaking of our auto industry everyone recognizes that years of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink we should not and will not protect them from their own bad practices but we are committed to the goal of a retooled reimagined auto industry that can compete and win millions of jobs depend on it scores of communities depend on it and i believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it  now none of this will come without cost nor will it be easy but this is america we dont do whats easy we do whats necessary to move this country forward  and for that same reason we must also address the crushing cost of health care this is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in america every 30 seconds by the end of the year it could cause 15 million americans to lose their homes in the last 8 years premiums have grown four times faster than wages and in each of these years 1 million more americans have lost their health insurance it is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas and its one of the largest and fastest growing parts of our budget given these facts we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold we cant afford to do it its time  already weve done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last 30 days than weve done in the last decade when it was days old this congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million american children whose parents work full time our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records a new technology that will reduce errors bring down costs ensure privacy and save lives it will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every american including me by seeking a cure for cancer in our time and it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care because thats one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control  this budget builds on these reforms it includes a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform a down payment on the principle that we must have quality affordable health care for every american its a commitment thats paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue and its a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come  now there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform and thats why im bringing together businesses and workers doctors and health care providers democrats and republicans to begin work on this issue next week  i suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process once again it will be hard but i also know that nearly a century after teddy roosevelt first called for reform the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and our conscience long enough so let there be no doubt health care reform cannot wait it must not wait and it will not wait another year  the third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in america in a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity it is a prerequisite right now threequarters of the fastest growing occupations require more than a high school diploma and yet just over half of our citizens have that level of education we have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation and half of the students who begin college never finish  this is a prescription for economic decline because we know the countries that outteach us today will outcompete us tomorrow that is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education from the day they are born to the day they begin a career that is a promise we have to make to the children of america  already weve made historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan weve dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life weve made college affordable for nearly 7 million more students7 million and we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our childrens progress  but we know that our schools dont just need more resources they need more reform and that is why this budget creates new teachersnew incentives for teacher performance pathways for advancement and rewards for success well invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps and we will expand our commitment to charter schools  it is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work but it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it so tonight i ask every american to commit to at least 1 year or more of higher education or career training this can be community college or a 4year school vocational training or an apprenticeship but whatever the training may be every american will need to get more than a high school diploma  and dropping out of high school is no longer an option its not just quitting on yourself its quitting on your country and this country needs and values the talents of every american thats why we will supportwe will provide the support necessary for all young americans to complete college and meet a new goal by 2020 america will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world that is a goal we can meet thats a goal we can meet  now i know that the price of tuition is higher than ever which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country we will make sure that you can afford a higher education and to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations i ask congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of senator orrin hatch as well as an american who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country senator edward kennedy  these education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them in the end there is no program or policy that can substitute for a parent for a mother or father who will attend those parentteacher conferences or help with homework or turn off the tv put away the video games read to their child i speak to you not just as a president but as a father when i say that responsibility for our childrens education must begin at home that is not a democratic issue or a republican issue thats an american issue  there is of course another responsibility we have to our children and thats the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay that is critical applause i agree absolutely see i know we can get some consensus in here laughter with the deficit we inherited the cost of the crisis we face and the longterm challenges we must meet it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers we do what it takes to bring this deficit down that is critical  now im proud that we passed a recovery plan free of earmarks and i want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities  and yesterday i held a fiscal summit where i pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office my administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs as you can imagine this is a process that will take some time but we have already identified 2 trillion in savings over the next decade  in this budget we will end education programs that dont work and end direct payments to large agribusiness that dont need them well eliminate the nobid contracts that have wasted billions in iraq and reform our defense budget so that were not paying for cold warera weapons systems we dont use we will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our medicare program that doesnt make our seniors any healthier we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas  in order to save our children from a future of debt we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans now let me be clearlet me be absolutely clear because i know youll end up hearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the american people if your family earns less than 250000 a year a quarter million dollars a year you will not see your taxes increased a single dime i repeat not one single dime in factnot a dimein fact the recovery plan provides a tax cutthats right a tax cutfor 95 percent of working families and by the way these checks are on the way  now to preserve our longterm fiscal health we must also address the growing costs in medicare and social security comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen medicare for years to come and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for social security while creating taxfree universal savings accounts for all americans  finally because were also suffering from a deficit of trust i am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget that is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules and for the first time that includes the full cost of fighting in iraq and afghanistan for 7 years we have been a nation at war no longer will we hide its price  along with our outstanding national security team im now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars and i will soon announce a way forward in iraq that leaves iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war  and with our friends and allies we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for afghanistan and pakistan to defeat al qaida and combat extremism because i will not allow terrorists to plot against the american people from safe havens halfway around the world we will not allow it  as we meet here tonight our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy to each and every one of them and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence americans are united in sending one message we honor your service we are inspired by your sacrifice and you have our unyielding support  to relieve the strain on our forces my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines and to keep our sacred trust with those who serve we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned   to overcome extremism we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of america and that is why i have ordered the closing of the detention center at guantanamo bay and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists because living our values doesnt make us weaker it makes us safer and it makes us stronger and that is why i can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the united states of america does not torture we can make that commitment here tonight  in words and deeds we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun for we know that america cannot meet the threats of this century alone but the world cannot meet them without america we cannot shun the negotiating table nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm we are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand  to seek progress towards a secure and lasting peace between israel and her neighbors we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort to meet the challenges of the 21st centuryfrom terrorism to nuclear proliferation from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing povertywe will strengthen old alliances forge new ones and use all elements of our national power  and to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope we are working with the nations of the g20 to restore confidence in our financial system avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism and spur demand for american goods in markets across the globe for the world depends on us having a strong economy just as our economy depends on the strength of the worlds  as we stand at this crossroads of history the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us watching to see what we do with this moment waiting for us to lead those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times it is a tremendous burden but also a great privilege one that has been entrusted to few generations of americans for in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill  i know that its easy to lose sight of this truth to become cynical and doubtful consumed with the petty and the trivial but in my life i have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity but from the dreams and aspirations of ordinary americans who are anything but ordinary  i think of leonard abess a bank president from miami who reportedly cashed out of his company took a 60 million bonus and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him plus another 72 who used to work for him he didnt tell anyone but when the local newspaper found out he simply said i knew some of these people since i was 7 years old it didnt feel right getting the money myself  i think about greensburg kansas a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay the tragedy was terrible said one of the men who helped them rebuild but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity  i think about tysheoma bethea the young girl from that school i visited in dillon south carolina a place where the ceilings leak the paint peels off the walls and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom she had been told that her school is hopeless but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this chamber she even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp the letter asks us for help and says we are just students trying to become lawyers doctors congressmen like yourself and one day president so we can make a change to not just the state of south carolina but also the world we are not quitters thats what she said we are not quitters  these words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here they tell us that even in the most trying times amid the most difficult circumstances there is a generosity a resilience a decency and a determination that perseveres a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity their resolve must be our inspiration their concerns must be our cause and we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us  i knowlook i know that we havent agreed on every issue thus far laughter there are surely times in the future where we will part ways but i also know that every american who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed i know that that must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months and where we return after those debates are done that is the foundation on which the american people expect us to build common ground  and if we do if we come together and lift this nation from the depths of this crisis if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an america that does not quit then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed in the words that are carved into this very chamber something worthy to be remembered  thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america thank you   
217, Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union, Barack Obama,2010-01-27,   madam speaker vice president biden members of congress distinguished guests and fellow americans our constitution declares that from time to time the president shall give to congress information about the state of our union for 220 years our leaders have fulfilled this duty theyve done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility and theyve done so in the midst of war and depression at moments of great strife and great struggle  its tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable that america was always destined to succeed but when the union was turned back at bull run and the allies first landed at omaha beach victory was very much in doubt when the market crashed on black tuesday and marchers were beaten on bloody sunday the future was anything but certain these were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our union and despite all our divisions and disagreements our hesitations and our fears america prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation as one people again we are tested and again we must answer historys call  one year ago i took office amid two wars an economy rocked by a severe recession a financial system on the verge of collapse and a government deeply in debt experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act we might face a second depression so we acted immediately and aggressively and 1 year later the worst of the storm has passed  but the devastation remains one in 10 americans still cannot find work many businesses have shuttered home values have declined small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard and for those whod already known poverty lifes become that much harder  this recession has also compounded the burdens that americas families have been dealing with for decades the burden of working harder and longer for less of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college  so i know the anxieties that are out there right now theyre not new these struggles are the reason i ran for president these struggles are what ive witnessed for years in places like elkhart indiana galesburg illinois i hear about them in the letters that i read each night the toughest to read are those written by children asking why they have to move from their home asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work  for these americans and so many others change has not come fast enough some are frustrated some are angry they dont understand why it seems like bad behavior on wall street is rewarded but hard work on main street isnt or why washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems theyre tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness they know we cant afford it not now  so we face big and difficult challenges and what the american people hope what they deserve is for all of us democrats and republicans to work through our differences to overcome the numbing weight of our politics for while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds different stories different beliefs the anxieties they face are the same the aspirations they hold are shared a job that pays the bills a chance to get ahead most of all the ability to give their children a better life  and you know what else they share they share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity after one of the most difficult years in our history they remain busy building cars and teaching kids starting businesses and going back to school theyre coaching little league and helping their neighbors one woman wrote to me and said we are strained but hopeful struggling but encouraged  its because of this spirit this great decency and great strength that i have never been more hopeful about americas future than i am tonight despite our hardships our union is strong we do not give up we do not quit we do not allow fear or division to break our spirit in this new decade its time the american people get a government that matches their decency that embodies their strength and tonight id like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise  it begins with our economy our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis it was not easy to do and if theres one thing that has unified democrats and republicans and everybody in between its that we all hated the bank bailout i hated it i hated it you hated it it was about as popular as a root canal laughter  but when i ran for president i promised i wouldnt just do what was popular i would do what was necessary and if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system unemployment might be double what it is today more businesses would certainly have closed more homes would have surely been lost  so i supported the last administrations efforts to create the financial rescue program and when we took that program over we made it more transparent and more accountable and as a result the markets are now stabilized and weve recovered most of the money we spent on the banksmost but not all  to recover the rest ive proposed a fee on the biggest banks now i know wall street isnt keen on this idea but if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need  now as we stabilized the financial system we also took steps to get our economy growing again save as many jobs as possible and help americans who had become unemployed thats why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million americans made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through cobra and passed 25 different tax cuts  now let me repeat we cut taxes we cut taxes for 95 percent of working families we cut taxes for small businesses we cut taxes for firsttime home buyers we cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children we cut taxes for 8 million americans paying for college applause i thought id get some applause on that one laughter  as a result millions of americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities all of which helped businesses keep more workers and we havent raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person not a single dime  now because of the steps we took there are about 2 million americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy three hundred thousand are teachers and other education workers tens of thousands are cops firefighters correctional officers firstresponders and were on track to add another 1 12 million jobs to this total by the end of the year  the plan that has made all of this possible from the tax cuts to the jobs is the recovery act thats right the recovery act also known as the stimulus bill economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster but you dont have to take their word for it talk to the small business in phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the recovery act talk to the window manufacturer in philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the recovery act until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the recovery act she wouldnt be laid off after all  there are stories like this all across america and after 2 years of recession the economy is growing again retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value businesses are beginning to invest again and slowly some are starting to hire again  but i realize that for every success story there are other stories of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response that is why jobs must be our numberone focus in 2010 and thats why im calling for a new jobs bill tonight  now the true engine of job creation in this country will always be americas businesses applause i agree absolutely but government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers we should start where most new jobs do in small businesses companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides its time she became her own boss through sheer grit and determination these companies have weathered the recession and theyre ready to grow but when you talk to small business owners in places like allentown pennsylvania or elyria ohio you find out that even though banks on wall street are lending again theyre mostly lending to bigger companies financing remains difficult for smallbusiness owners across the country even those that are making a profit  so tonight im proposing that we take 30 billion of the money wall street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat im also proposing a new small business tax credit one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages while were at it lets also eliminate all capital gains taxes on smallbusiness investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment  next we can put americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow from the first railroads to the interstate highway system our nation has always been built to compete theres no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products tomorrow ill visit tampa florida where workers will soon break ground on a new highspeed railroad funded by the recovery act there are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nations goods services and information  we should put more americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to americans who make their homes more energy efficient which supports clean energy jobs and to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the united states of america  now the house has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps as the first order of business this year i urge the senate to do the same and i know they will they will people are out of work theyre hurting they need our help and i want a jobs bill on my desk without delay  but the truth is these steps wont make up for the 7 million jobs that weve lost over the last 2 years the only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for longterm economic growth and finally address the problems that americas families have confronted for years  we cant afford another socalled economic expansion like the one from the last decade what some call the lost decade where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion where the income of the average american household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation  from the day i took office ive been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious such an effort would be too contentious ive been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while for those who make these claims i have one simple question how long should we wait how long should america put its future on hold  you see washington has been telling us to wait for decades even as the problems have grown worse meanwhile chinas not waiting to revamp its economy germanys not waiting indias not waiting these nations aretheyre not standing still these nations arent playing for second place theyre putting more emphasis on math and science theyre rebuilding their infrastructure theyre making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs well i do not accept second place for the united states of america as hard as it may be as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become its time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth  now one place to start is serious financial reform look i am not interested in punishing banks im interested in protecting our economy a strong healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs it channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes but that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy  we need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions we cant allow financial institutions including those that take your deposits to take risks that threaten the whole economy  now the house has already passed financial reform with many of these changes and the lobbyists are trying to kill it but we cannot let them win this fight and if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform i will send it back until we get it right weve got to get it right  next we need to encourage american innovation last year we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history an investment that could lead to the worlds cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched and no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy you can see the results of last years investments in clean energy in the north carolina company that will create 1200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the california business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels  but to create more of these clean energy jobs we need more production more efficiency more incentives and that means building a new generation of safe clean nuclear power plants in this country it means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development it means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies and yes it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in america now i am grateful to the house for passing such a bill last year and this year im eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the senate  i know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy i know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change but heres the thing even if you doubt the evidence providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy and america must be that nation  third we need to export more of our goods because the more products we make and sell to other countries the more jobs we support right here in america so tonight we set a new goal we will double our exports over the next 5 years an increase that will support 2 million jobs in america to help meet this goal were launching a national export initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security  we have to seek new markets aggressively just as our competitors are if america sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores but realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules and thats why well continue to shape a doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in asia and with key partners like south korea and panama and colombia  fourth we need to invest in the skills and education of our people now this year weve broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools and the idea here is simple instead of rewarding failure we only reward success instead of funding the status quo we only invest in reform reform that raises student achievement inspires students to excel in math and science and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young americans from rural communities to the inner city in the 21st century the best antipoverty program around is a worldclass education and in this country the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential when we renew the elementary and secondary education act we will work with congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states  still in this economy a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job thats why i urge the senate to follow the house and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families  to make college more affordable this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans instead lets take that money and give families a 10000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase pell grants and lets tell another 1 million students that when they graduate they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service because in the united states of america no one should go broke because they chose to go to college and by the way its time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem  now the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class thats why last year i asked vice president biden to chair a task force on middle class families thats why were nearly doubling the childcare tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg thats why were working to lift the value of a familys single largest investment their home the steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of americans to take out new loans and save an average of 1500 on mortgage payments this year we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages  and it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health insurance reform yes we do  now lets clear a few things up i didnt choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt and by now it should be fairly obvious that i didnt take on health care because it was good politics laughter i took on health care because of the stories ive heard from americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage patients whove been denied coverage families even those with insurance who are just one illness away from financial ruin  after nearly a century of tryingdemocratic administrations republican administrationswe are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many americans the approach weve taken would protect every american from the worst practices of the insurance industry it would give small businesses and uninsured americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market it would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care  and by the way i want to acknowledge our first lady michelle obama who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier applause thank you honey she gets embarrassed laughter  our approach would preserve the right of americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan it would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses and according to the congressional budget office the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for congress our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as 1 trillion over the next two decades  still this is a complex issue and the longer it was debated the more skeptical people became i take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the american people and i know that with all the lobbying and horsetrading the process left most americans wondering whats in it for me  but i also know this problem is not going away by the time im finished speaking tonight more americans will have lost their health insurance millions will lose it this year our deficit will grow premiums will go up patients will be denied the care they need small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether i will not walk away from these americans and neither should the people in this chamber  so as temperatures cool i want everyone to take another look at the plan weve proposed theres a reason why many doctors nurses and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo but if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums bring down the deficit cover the uninsured strengthen medicare for seniors and stop insurance company abuses let me know let me know let me know im eager to see it  heres what i ask congress though dont walk away from reform not now not when we are so close let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the american people lets get it done lets get it done  now even as health care reform would reduce our deficit its not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves its a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one thats been subject to a lot of political posturing so let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight  at the beginning of the last decade the year 2000 america had a budget surplus of over 200 billion by the time i took office we had a 1year deficit of over 1 trillion and projected deficits of 8 trillion over the next decade most of this was the result of not paying for two wars two tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program on top of that the effects of the recession put a 3 trillion hole in our budget all this was before i walked in the door laughter  nowapplausejust stating the facts now if we had taken office in ordinary times i would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit but we took office amid a crisis and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another 1 trillion to our national debt that too is a fact  im absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do but families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions the federal government should do the same so tonight im proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year  starting in 2011 we are prepared to freeze government spending for 3 years spending related to our national security medicare medicaid and social security will not be affected but all other discretionary government programs will like any cashstrapped family we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we dont and if i have to enforce this discipline by veto i will  we will continue to go through the budget line by line page by page to eliminate programs that we cant afford and dont work weve already identified 20 billion in savings for next year to help working families well extend our middle class tax cuts but at a time of record deficits we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies for investment fund managers and for those making over 250000 a year we just cant afford it  now even after paying for what we spent on my watch well still face the massive deficit we had when i took office more importantly the cost of medicare medicaid and social security will continue to skyrocket thats why ive called for a bipartisan fiscal commission modeled on a proposal by republican judd gregg and democrat kent conrad this cant be one of those washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem the commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline  now yesterday the senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission so ill issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward because i refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of americans and when the vote comes tomorrow the senate should restore the payasyougo law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s  now i know that some in my own party will argue that we cant address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting and i agree which is why this freeze wont take effect until next year when the economy is stronger thats how budgeting works laughter but understand if we dont take meaningful steps to rein in our debt it could damage our markets increase the cost of borrowing and jeopardize our recovery all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes  from some on the right i expect well hear a different argument that if we just make fewer investments in our people extend tax cuts including those for the wealthier americans eliminate more regulations maintain the status quo on health care our deficits will go away the problem is thats what we did for 8 years thats what helped us into this crisis its what helped lead to these deficits we cant do it again  rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated washington for decades its time to try something new lets invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt lets meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here lets try common senselaughtera novel concept  now to do that we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now we face a deficit of trust deep and corrosive doubts about how washington works that have been growing for years to close that credibility gap we have to take action on both ends of pennsylvania avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists to do our work openly to give our people the government they deserve  now thats what i came to washington to do thats why for the first time in history my administration posts onour white house visitors online thats why weve excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions but we cant stop there its time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with congress its time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office  with all due deference to separation of powers last week the supreme court reversed a century of law that i believe will open the floodgates for special interests including foreign corporations to spend without limit in our elections i dont think american elections should be bankrolled by americas most powerful interests or worse by foreign entities they should be decided by the american people and id urge democrats and republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems  im also calling on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform democrats and republicansdemocrats and republicans look youve trimmed some of this spending youve embraced some meaningful change but restoring the public trust demands more for example some members of congress post some earmark requests online tonight im calling on congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before theres a vote so that the american people can see how their money is being spent  of course none of these reforms will even happen if we dont also reform how we work with one another now im not naive i never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony andlaughtersome postpartisan era i knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched and on some issues there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways these disagreements about the role of government in our lives about our national priorities and our national security theyve been taking place for over 200 years theyre the very essence of our democracy  but what frustrates the american people is a washington where every day is election day we cant wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side a belief that if you lose i win neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can the confirmation of im speaking to both parties nowthe confirmation of wellqualified public servants shouldnt be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators  washington may think that saying anything about the other side no matter how false no matter how malicious is just part of the game but its precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the american people worse yet its sowing further division among our citizens further distrust in our government so no i will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics i know its an election year and after last week its clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual but we still need to govern  to democrats i would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems not run for the hills and if the republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the senate are required to do any business at all in this towna supermajoritythen the responsibility to govern is now yours as well just saying no to everything may be good shortterm politics but its not leadership we were sent here to serve our citizens not our ambitions so lets show the american people that we can do it together  this week ill be addressing a meeting of the house republicans id like to begin monthly meetings with both democratic and republican leadership i know you cant wait laughter  now throughout our history no issue has united this country more than our security sadly some of the unity we felt after 911 has dissipated and we can argue all we want about whos to blame for this but im not interested in relitigating the past i know that all of us love this country all of us are committed to its defense so lets put aside the schoolyard taunts about whos tough lets reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values lets leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future for america and for the world  thats the work we began last year since the day i took office weve renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation weve made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take american lives we are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed christmas attack with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence weve prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the pacific to south asia to the arabian peninsula and in the last year hundreds of al qaidas fighters and affiliates including many senior leaders have been captured or killed far more than in 2008  and in afghanistan were increasing our troops and training afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in july of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home we will reward good governance work to reduce corruption and support the rights of all afghans men and women alike were joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments and who will come together tomorrow in london to reaffirm our common purpose there will be difficult days ahead but i am absolutely confident we will succeed  as we take the fight to al qaida we are responsibly leaving iraq to its people as a candidate i promised that i would end this war and that is what i am doing as president we will have all of our combat troops out of iraq by the end of this august we will support the iraqi government as they hold elections and we will continue to partner with the iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity but make no mistake this war is ending and all of our troops are coming home  tonight all of our men and women in uniform in iraq in afghanistan and around the world they have to know that wethat they have our respect our gratitude our full support and just as they must have the resources they need in war we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home thats why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year thats why were building a 21stcentury va and thats why michelle has joined with jill biden to forge a national commitment to support military families  now even as we prosecute two wars were also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the american people the threat of nuclear weapons ive embraced the vision of john f kennedy and ronald reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them to reduce our stockpiles and launchers while ensuring our deterrent the united states and russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades and at aprils nuclear security summit we will bring 44 nations together here in washington dc behind a clear goal securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists  now these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons thats why north korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions sanctions that are being vigorously enforced thats why the international community is more united and the islamic republic of iran is more isolated and as irans leaders continue to ignore their obligations there should be no doubt they too will face growing consequences that is a promise  thats the leadership we are providing engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people were working through the g20 to sustain a lasting global recovery were working with muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation we have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change were helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against hivaids and we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad  as we have for over 60 years america takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores but we also do it because it is right thats why as we meet here tonight over 10000 americans are working with many nations to help the people of haiti recover and rebuild thats why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in afghanistan why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of iran why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in guinea for america must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignityalways  abroad americas greatest source of strength has always been our ideals the same is true at home we find unity in our incredible diversity drawing on the promise enshrined in our constitution the notion that were all created equal that no matter who you are or what you look like if you abide by the law you should be protected by it if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no different than anyone else  we must continually renew this promise my administration has a division that is once again prosecuting violations and employment discrimination we finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate this year i will work with congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are its the right thing to do  were going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws so that women get equal pay for an equal days work and we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system to secure our borders and enforce our laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation  in the end its our ideals our values that built america values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe values that drive our citizens still every day americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers time and again they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country they take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit these arent republican values or democratic values that theyre living by business values or labor values theyre american values  unfortunately too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutionsour corporations our media and yes our governmentstill reflect these same values each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper but each time a ceo rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain peoples doubts grow each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up we lose faith the more that tv pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments big issues into sound bites our citizens turn away no wonder theres so much cynicism out there no wonder theres so much disappointment  i campaigned on the promise of change change we can believe in the slogan went and right now i know there are many americans who arent sure if they still believe we can change or that i can deliver it  but remember this i never suggested that change would be easy or that i could do it alone democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated and when you try to do big things and make big changes it stirs passions and controversy thats just how it is  those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers we can do whats necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election instead of doing whats best for the next generation  but i also know this if people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago we wouldnt be here tonight the only reason we are here is because generations of americans were unafraid to do what was hard to do what was needed even when success was uncertain to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren  now our administration has had some political setbacks this year and some of them were deserved but i wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year and what keeps me going what keeps me fighting is that despite all these setbacks that spirit of determination and optimism that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the american people that lives on  it lives on in the struggling smallbusiness owner who wrote to me of his company none of us he said    are willing to consider even slightly that we might fail it lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession we are strong we are resilient we are american it lives on in the 8yearold boy in louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if i would give it to the people of haiti and it lives on in all the americans whove dropped everything to go someplace theyve never been and pull people theyve never known from the rubble prompting chants of usa usa usa when another life was saved  the spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you its people we have finished a difficult year we have come through a difficult decade but a new year has come a new decade stretches before us we dont quit i dont quit lets seize this moment to start anew to carry the dream forward and to strengthen our union once more  thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america   
218, Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union, Barack Obama,2011-01-25,   mr speaker mr vice president members of congress distinguished guests and fellow americans tonight i want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th congress as well as your new speaker john boehner and as we mark this occasion were also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber and we pray for the health of our colleague and our friend gabby giffords  its no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last 2 years the debates have been contentious we have fought fiercely for our beliefs and thats a good thing thats what a robust democracy demands thats what helps set us apart as a nation  but theres a reason the tragedy in tucson gave us pause amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from each of us is a part of something greater something more consequential than party or political preference  we are part of the american family we believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found we are still bound together as one people that we share common hopes and a common creed that the dreams of a little girl in tucson are not so different than those of our own children that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled that too is what sets us apart as a nation  now by itself this simple recognition wont usher in a new era of cooperation what comes of this moment is up to us what comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight but whether we can work together tomorrow  i believe we can and i believe we must thats what the people who sent us here expect of us with their votes theyve determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties new laws will only pass with support from democrats and republicans we will move forward together or not at all for the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than politics  at stake right now is not who wins the next election after all we just had an election at stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country or somewhere else its whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded its whether we sustain the leadership that has made america not just a place on a map but the light to the world  we are poised for progress two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known the stock market has come roaring back corporate profits are up the economy is growing again  but we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone we measure progress by the success of our people by the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer by the prospects of a smallbusiness owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise by the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children  thats the project the american people want us to work ontogether  now we did that in december thanks to the tax cuts we passed americans paychecks are a little bigger today every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year and these steps taken by democrats and republicans will grow the economy and add to the more than 1 million private sector jobs created last year  but we have to do more these steps weve taken over the last 2 years may have broken the back of this recession but to win the future well need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making  many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown you didnt always need a degree and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors if you worked hard chances are youd have a job for life with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion maybe youd even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company  that world has changed and for many the change has been painful ive seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories and the vacant storefronts on once busy main streets ive heard it in the frustrations of americans whove seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game  theyre right the rules have changed in a single generation revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live work and do business steel mills that once needed 1000 workers can now do the same work with 100 today just about any company can set up shop hire workers and sell their products wherever theres an internet connection  meanwhile nations like china and india realized that with some changes of their own they could compete in this new world and so they started educating their children earlier and longer with greater emphasis on math and science theyre investing in research and new technologies just recently china became the home to the worlds largest private solar research facility and the worlds fastest computer  so yes the world is changed the competition for jobs is real but this shouldnt discourage us it should challenge us remember for all the hits weve taken these last few years for all the naysayers predicting our decline america still has the largest most prosperous economy in the world no workers are more productive than ours no country has more successful companies or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs were the home to the worlds best colleges and universities where more students come to study than any place on earth  whats more we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny thats why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here its why our students dont just memorize equations but answer questions like what do you think of that idea what would you change about the world what do you want to be when you grow up  the future is ours to win but to get there we cant just stand still as robert kennedy told us the future is not a gift it is an achievement sustaining the american dream has never been about standing pat it has required each generation to sacrifice and struggle and meet the demands of a new age  and now its our turn we know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time we need to outinnovate outeducate and outbuild the rest of the world we have to make america the best place on earth to do business we need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government thats how our people will prosper thats how well win the future and tonight id like to talk about how we get there  the first step in winning the future is encouraging american innovation none of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from thirty years ago we couldnt know that something called the internet would lead to an economic revolution what we can dowhat america does better than anyone else is spark the creativity and imagination of our people were the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices the nation of edison and the wright brothers of google and facebook in america innovation doesnt just change our lives it is how we make our living  our free enterprise system is what drives innovation but because its not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research throughout our history our government has provided cuttingedge scientists and inventors with the support that they need thats what planted the seeds for the internet thats what helped make possible things like computer chips and gps just think of all the good jobs from manufacturing to retailthat have come from these breakthroughs  half a century ago when the soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called sputnik we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon the science wasnt even there yet nasa didnt exist but after investing in better research and education we didnt just surpass the soviets we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs  this is our generations sputnik moment two years ago i said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we havent seen since the height of the space race and in a few weeks i will be sending a budget to congress that helps us meet that goal well invest in biomedical research information technology and especially clean energy technology an investment that will strengthen our security protect our planet and create countless new jobs for our people  already were seeing the promise of renewable energy robert and gary allen are brothers who run a small michigan roofing company after september 11 they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the pentagon but half of their factory went unused and the recession hit them hard today with the help of a government loan that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country in roberts words we reinvented ourselves  thats what americans have done for over 200 years reinvented ourselves and to spur on more success stories like the allen brothers weve begun to reinvent our energy policy were not just handing out money were issuing a challenge were telling americas scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy well fund the apollo projects of our time  at the california institute of technology theyre developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars at oak ridge national laboratory theyre using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities with more research and incentives we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015  we need to get behind this innovation and to help pay for it im asking congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies i dont know if youve noticed but theyre doing just fine on their own laughter so instead of subsidizing yesterdays energy lets invest in tomorrows  now clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what theyre selling so tonight i challenge you to join me in setting a new goal by 2035 80 percent of americas electricity will come from clean energy sources  some folks want wind and solar others want nuclear clean coal and natural gas to meet this goal we will need them all and i urge democrats and republicans to work together to make it happen  maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to americas success but if we want to win the future if we want innovation to produce jobs in america and not overseas then we also have to win the race to educate our kids  think about it over the next 10 years nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education and yet as many as a quarter of our students arent even finishing high school the quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations america has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree and so the question is whether all of us as citizens and as parents are willing to do whats necessary to give every child a chance to succeed  that responsibility begins not in our classrooms but in our homes and communities its family that first instills the love of learning in a child only parents can make sure the tv is turned off and homework gets done we need to teach our kids that its not just the winner of the super bowl who deserves to be celebrated but the winner of the science fair we need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or pr but of hard work and discipline  our schools share this responsibility when a child walks into a classroom it should be a place of high expectations and high performance but too many schools dont meet this test thats why instead of just pouring money into a system thats not working we launched a competition called race to the top to all 50 states we said if you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement well show you the money  race to the top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation for less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning and these standards were developed by the way not by washington but by republican and democratic governors throughout the country and race to the top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace no child left behind with a law thats more flexible and focused on whats best for our kids  you see we know whats possible from our children when reform isnt just a topdown mandate but the work of local teachers and principals school boards and communities take a school like bruce randolph in denver three years ago it was rated one of the worst schools in colorado located on turf between two rival gangs but last may 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma most will be the first in their families to go to college and after the first year of the schools transformation the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said thank you ms waters for showing that we are smart and we can make it thats what good schools can do and we want good schools all across the country  lets also remember that after parents the biggest impact on a childs success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom in south korea teachers are known as nation builders here in america its time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect we want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones and over the next 10 years with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms we want to prepare 100000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math  in fact to every young person listening tonight whos contemplating their career choice if you want to make a difference in the life of our nation if you want to make a difference in the life of a child become a teacher your country needs you  of course the education race doesnt end with a high school diploma to compete higher education must be within the reach of every american thats why weve ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students and this year i ask congress to go further and make permanent our tuition tax credit worth 10000 for 4 years of college its the right thing to do  because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in todays fastchanging economy were also revitalizing americas community colleges last month i saw the promise of these schools at forsyth tech in north carolina many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town one mother of two a woman named kathy proctor had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old and she told me shes earning her degree in biotechnology now at 55 years old not just because the furniture jobs are gone but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams too as kathy said i hope it tells them to never give up  if we take these steps if we raise expectations for every child and give them the best possible chance at an education from the day they are born until the last job they take we will reach the goal that i set 2 years ago by the end of the decade america will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world  one last point about education today there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not american citizens some are the children of undocumented workers who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents they grew up as americans and pledge allegiance to our flag and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities but as soon as they obtain advanced degrees we send them back home to compete against us it makes no sense  now i strongly believe that we should take on once and for all the issue of illegal immigration and i am prepared to work with republicans and democrats to protect our borders enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows i know that debate will be difficult i know it will take time but tonight lets agree to make that effort and lets stop expelling talented responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business who could be further enriching this nation  the third step in winning the future is rebuilding america to attract new businesses to our shores we need the fastest most reliable ways to move people goods and information from highspeed rail to high speed internet  our infrastructure used to be the best but our lead has slipped south korean homes now have greater internet access than we do countries in europe and russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do china is building faster trains and newer airports meanwhile when our own engineers graded our nations infrastructure they gave us a d  we have to do better america is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad brought electricity to rural communities constructed the interstate highway system the jobs created by these projects didnt just come from laying down track or pavement they came from businesses that opened near a towns new train station or the new offramp  so over the last 2 years weve begun rebuilding for the 21st century a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hardhit construction industry and tonight im proposing that we redouble those efforts  well put more americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges well make sure this is fully paid for attract private investment and pick projects based on whats best for the economy not politicians  within 25 years our goal is to give 80 percent of americans access to highspeed rail this could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car for some trips it will be faster than flying without the patdown laughter as we speak routes in california and the midwest are already underway  within the next 5 years well make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of highspeed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all americans this isnt just aboutthis isnt about faster internet or fewer dropped calls its about connecting every part of america to the digital age its about a rural community in iowa or alabama where farmers and smallbusiness owners will be able to sell their products all over the world its about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device a student who can take classes with a digital textbook or a patient who can have facetoface video chats with her doctor  all these investmentsin innovation education and infrastructure will make america a better place to do business and create jobs but to help our companies compete we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success  for example over the years a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all but all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world it makes no sense and it has to change  so tonight im asking democrats and republicans to simplify the system get rid of the loopholes level the playing field and use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years without adding to our deficit it can be done  to help businesses sell more products abroad we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 because the more we export the more jobs we create here at home already our exports are up recently we signed agreements with india and china that will support more than 250000 jobs here in the united states and last month we finalized a trade agreement with south korea that will support at least 70000 american jobs this agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor democrats and republicans and i ask this congress to pass it as soon as possible  now before i took office i made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements and that i would only sign deals that keep faith with american workers and promote american jobs thats what we did with korea and thats what i intend to do as we pursue agreements with panama and colombia and continue our asiapacific and global trade talks  to reduce barriers to growth and investment ive ordered a review of government regulations when we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses we will fix them but i will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense safeguards to protect the american people thats what weve done in this country for more than a century its why our food is safe to eat our water is safe to drink and our air is safe to breathe its why we have speed limits and child labor laws its why last year we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis and its why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients  now i have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law laughter so let me be the first to say that anything can be improved if you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable i am eager to work with you we can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses  what im not willing to dowhat im not willing to dois go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition  im not willing to tell james howard a brain cancer patient from texas that his treatment might not be covered im not willing to tell jim houser a smallbusinessman from oregon that he has to go back to paying 5000 more to cover his employees as we speak this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patientsparents coverage  so i say to this chamber tonight instead of refighting the battles of the last 2 years lets fix what needs fixing and lets move forward  now the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we arent buried under a mountain of debt  we are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago and in the wake of the financial crisis some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing save jobs and put money in peoples pockets  but now that the worst of the recession is over we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in that is not sustainable every day families sacrifice to live within their means they deserve a government that does the same  so tonight i am proposing that starting this year we freeze annual domestic spending for the next 5 years now this would reduce the deficit by more than 400 billion over the next decade and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since dwight eisenhower was president  this freeze will require painful cuts already weve frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next 2 years ive proposed cuts to things i care deeply about like community action programs the secretary of defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without  now i recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts and im willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without but lets make sure that were not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens and lets make sure that what were cutting is really excess weight cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine it may make you feel like youre flying high at first but it wont take long before you feel the impact laughter  now most of the cuts and savings ive proposed only address annual domestic spending which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget to make further progress we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough it wont  the bipartisan fiscal commission i created last year made this crystal clear i dont agree with all their proposals but they made important progress and their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it in domestic spending defense spending health care spending and spending through tax breaks and loopholes  this means further reducing health care costs including programs like medicare and medicaid which are the single biggest contributor to our longterm deficit the health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit still im willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs including one that republicans suggested last year medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits  to put us on solid ground we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen social security for future generations we must do it without putting at risk current retirees the most vulnerable or people with disabilities without slashing benefits for future generations and without subjecting americans guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market  and if we truly care about our deficit we simply cant afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break its not a matter of punishing their success its about promoting americas success  in fact the best thing we could do on taxes for all americans is to simplify the individual tax code this will be a tough job but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this and i am prepared to join them  so now is the time to act now is the time for both sides and both houses of congress democrats and republicans to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done if we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits we can make the investments we need to win the future  let me take this one step further we shouldnt just give our people a government thats more affordable we should give them a government thats more competent and more efficient we cant win the future with a government of the past  we live and do business in the information age but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of blackandwhite tv there are 12 different agencies that deal with exports there are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy then theres my favorite example the interior department is in charge of salmon while theyre in fresh water but the commerce department handles them when theyre in saltwater laughter i hear it gets even more complicated once theyre smoked laughter  now weve made great strides over the last 2 years in using technology and getting rid of waste veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse were selling acres of federal office space that hasnt been used in years and well cut through redtape to get rid of more but we need to think bigger in the coming months my administration will develop a proposal to merge consolidate and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive america i will submit that proposal to congress for a vote and we will push to get it passed  in the coming year well also work to rebuild peoples faith in the institution of government because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent youll be able to go to a web site and get that information for the very first time in history because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists i ask congress to do what the white house has already done put that information online and because the american people deserve to know that special interests arent larding up legislation with pet projects both parties in congress should know this if a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside i will veto it i will veto it  the 21stcentury government thats open and competent a government that lives within its means an economy thats driven by new skills and new ideasour success in this new and changing world will require reform responsibility and innovation it will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs  just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders so can new threats and new challenges no single wall separates east and west no one rival superpower is aligned against us  and so we must defeat determined enemies wherever they are and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion and americas moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity and because weve begun this work tonight we can say that american leadership has been renewed and americas standing has been restored  look to iraq where nearly 100000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high american combat patrols have ended violence is down and a new government has been formed this year our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the iraqi people while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of iraq americas commitment has been kept the iraq war is coming to an end  of course as we speak al qaida and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals were disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies and as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders we are responding with the strength of our communities with respect for the rule of law and with the conviction that american muslims are a part of our american family  weve also taken the fight to al qaida and their allies abroad in afghanistan our troops have taken taliban strongholds and trained afghan security forces our purpose is clear by preventing the taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the afghan people we will deny al qaida the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 911  thanks to our heroic troops and civilians fewer afghans are under the control of the insurgency there will be tough fighting ahead and the afghan government will need to deliver better governance but we are strengthening the capacity of the afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them this year we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an afghan lead and this july we will begin to bring our troops home  in pakistan al qaidas leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001 their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield their safe havens are shrinking and weve sent a message from the afghan border to the arabian peninsula to all parts of the globe we will not relent we will not waver and we will defeat you  american leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war because republicans and democrats approved the new start treaty far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed because we rallied the world nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists  because of a diplomatic effort to insist that iran meet its obligations the iranian government now faces tougher sanctions tighter sanctions than ever before and on the korean peninsula we stand with our ally south korea and insist that north korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons  this is just a part of how were shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity with our european allies we revitalized nato and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense weve reset our relationship with russia strengthened asian alliances built new partnerships with nations like india  this march i will travel to brazil chile and el salvador to forge new alliances across the americas around the globe were standing with those who take responsibility helping farmers grow more food supporting doctors who care for the sick and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity  recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power it must also be the purpose behind it in south sudanwith our assistancethe people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war thousands lined up before dawn people danced in the streets one man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him this was a battlefield for most of my life he said now we want to be free  and we saw that same desire to be free in tunisia where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator and tonight let us be clear the united states of america stands with the people of tunisia and supports the democratic aspirations of all people  we must never forget that the things weve struggled for and fought for live in the hearts of people everywhere and we must always remember that the americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country  tonight let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families let us serve them as well as theyve served us by giving them the equipment they need by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation  our troops come from every corner of this country theyre black white latino asian native american they are christian and hindu jewish and muslim and yes we know that some of them are gay starting this year no american will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love and with that change i call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and rotc it is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past it is time to move forward as one nation  we should have no illusions about the work ahead of us reforming our schools changing the way we use energy reducing our deficit none of this will be easy all of it will take time and it will be harder because we will argue about everything the costs the details the letter of every law  of course some countries dont have this problem if the central government wants a railroad they build a railroad no matter how many homes get bulldozed if they dont want a bad story in the newspaper it doesnt get written  and yet as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be i know there isnt a person here who would trade places with any other nation on earth  we may have differences in policy but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our constitution we may have different opinions but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try we may have different backgrounds but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible no matter who you are no matter where you come from  that dream is why i can stand here before you tonight that dream is why a working class kid from scranton can sit behind me laughter that dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his fathers cincinnati bar can preside as speaker of the house in the greatest nation on earth  that dreamthat american dreamis what drove the allen brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era its what drove those students at forsyth tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future and that dream is the story of a smallbusiness owner named brandon fisher  brandon started a company in berlin pennsylvania that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology and one day last summer he saw the news that halfway across the world 33 men were trapped in a chilean mine and no one knew how to save them  but brandon thought his company could help and so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as plan b his employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment and brandon left for chile  along with others he began drilling a 2000foot hole into the ground working 3 or 4 hour3 or 4 days at a time without any sleep thirty seven days later plan b succeeded and the miners were rescued but because he didnt want all of the attention brandon wasnt there when the miners emerged hed already gone back home back to work on his next project  and later one of his employees said of the rescue we proved that center rock is a little company but we do big things  we do big things  from the earliest days of our founding america has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream thats how we win the future  were a nation that says i might not have a lot of money but i have this great idea for a new company i might not come from a family of college graduates but i will be the first to get my degree i might not know those people in trouble but i think i can help them and i need to try im not sure how well reach that better place beyond the horizon but i know well get there i know we will  we do big things  the idea of america endures our destiny remains our choice and tonight more than two centuries later its because of our people that our future is hopeful our journey goes forward and the state of our union is strong  thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america   
219, Address Before a Joint Session of Congress on the State of the Union, Barack Obama,2012-01-24,   mr speaker mr vice president members of congress distinguished guests and fellow americans last month i went to andrews air force base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in iraq together we offered a final proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought and several thousand gave their lives  we gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the united states safer and more respected around the world for the first time in 9 years there are no americans fighting in iraq for the first time in two decades usama bin laden is not a threat to this country most of al qaidas top lieutenants have been defeated the talibans momentum has been broken and some troops in afghanistan have begun to come home  these achievements are a testament to the courage selflessness and teamwork of americas armed forces at a time when too many of our institutions have let us down they exceed all expectations theyre not consumed with personal ambition they dont obsess over their differences they focus on the mission at hand they work together  imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example think about the america within our reach a country that leads the world in educating its people an america that attracts a new generation of hightech manufacturing and highpaying jobs a future where were in control of our own energy and our security and prosperity arent so tied to unstable parts of the world an economy built to last where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded  we can do this i know we can because weve done it before at the end of world war ii when another generation of heroes returned home from combat they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known my grandfather a veteran of pattons army got the chance to go to college on the gi bill my grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on earth  the two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism they understood they were part of something larger that they were contributing to a story of success that every american had a chance to share the basic american promise that if you worked hard you could do well enough to raise a family own a home send your kids to college and put a little away for retirement  the defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive no challenge is more urgent no debate is more important we can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of americans barely get by or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules whats at stake arent democratic values or republican values but american values and we have to reclaim them  lets remember how we got here long before the recession jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores technology made businesses more efficient but also made some jobs obsolete folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before but most hardworking americans struggled with costs that were growing paychecks that werent and personal debt that kept piling up  in 2008 the house of cards collapsed we learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldnt afford or understand them banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other peoples money regulators had looked the other way or didnt have the authority to stop the bad behavior  it was wrong it was irresponsible and it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work saddled us with more debt and left innocent hardworking americans holding the bag in the 6 months before i took office we lost nearly 4 million jobs and we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect  those are the facts but so are these in the last 22 months businesses have created more than 3 million jobs last year they created the most jobs since 2005 american manufacturers are hiring again creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s together weve agreed to cut the deficit by more than 2 trillion and weve put in place new rules to hold wall street accountable so a crisis like this never happens again  the state of our union is getting stronger and weve come too far to turn back now as long as im president i will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum but i intend to fight obstruction with action and i will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place  no we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing bad debt and phony financial profits tonight i want to speak about how we move forward and lay out a blueprint for an economy thats built to last an economy built on american manufacturing american energy skills for american workers and a renewal of american values  now this blueprint begins with american manufacturing  on the day i took office our auto industry was on the verge of collapse some even said we should let it die with a million jobs at stake i refused to let that happen in exchange for help we demanded responsibility we got workers and automakers to settle their differences we got the industry to retool and restructure today general motors is back on top as the worlds numberone automaker chrysler has grown faster in the us than any major car company ford is investing billions in us plants and factories and together the entire industry added nearly a hundred and sixty thousand jobs  we bet on american workers we bet on american ingenuity and tonight the american auto industry is back  whats happening in detroit can happen in other industries it can happen in cleveland and pittsburgh and raleigh we cant bring every job back thats left our shore but right now its getting more expensive to do business in places like china meanwhile america is more productive a few weeks ago the ceo of master lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home today for the first time in 15 years master locks unionized plant in milwaukee is running at full capacity   so we have a huge opportunity at this moment to bring manufacturing back but we have to seize it tonight my message to business leaders is simple ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed  we should start with our tax code right now companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas meanwhile companies that choose to stay in america get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world it makes no sense and everyone knows it so lets change it  first if youre a business that wants to outsource jobs you shouldnt get a tax deduction for doing it that money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like master lock that decide to bring jobs home  second no american company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas from now on every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax and every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in america  third if youre an american manufacturer you should get a bigger tax cut if youre a hightech manufacturer we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here and if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town you should get help financing a new plant equipment or training for new workers  so my message is simple it is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in america send me these tax reforms and i will sign them right away  were also making it easier for american businesses to sell products all over the world two years ago i set a goal of doubling us exports over 5 years with the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law were on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule and soon there will be millions of new customers for american goods in panama colombia and south korea soon there will be new cars on the streets of seoul imported from detroit and toledo and chicago  i will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for american products and i will not stand by when our competitors dont play by the rules weve brought trade cases against china at nearly twice the rate as the last administration and its made a difference over a thousand americans are working today because we stopped a surge in chinese tires but we need to do more its not right when another country lets our movies music and software be pirated its not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because theyre heavily subsidized  tonight im announcing the creation of a trade enforcement unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like china there will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders and this congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over american manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like russia our workers are the most productive on earth and if the playing field is level i promise you america will always win  i also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the united states but cant find workers with the right skills growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job think about that openings at a time when millions of americans are looking for work its inexcusable and we know how to fix it  jackie bray is a single mom from north carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic then siemens opened a gas turbine factory in charlotte and formed a partnership with central piedmont community college the company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training it paid jackies tuition then hired her to help operate their plant  i want every american looking for work to have the same opportunity as jackie did join me in a national commitment to train 2 million americans with skills that will lead directly to a job my administration has already lined up more companies that want to help model partnerships between businesses like siemens and community colleges in places like charlotte and orlando and louisville are up and running now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now from data management to hightech manufacturing  and i want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs so that from now on people like jackie have one program one web site and one place to go for all the information and help that they need it is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work  these reforms will help people get jobs that are open today but to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier  for less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year weve convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning the first time thats happened in a generation but challenges remain and we know how to solve them  at a time when other countries are doubling down on education tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers we know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over 250000 a great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives most teachers work tirelessly with modest pay sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies just to make a difference  teachers matter so instead of bashing them or defending the status quo lets offer schools a deal give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job and reward the best ones and in return grant schools flexibility to teach with creativity and passion to stop teaching to the test and to replace teachers who just arent helping kids learn thats a bargain worth making  we also know that when students dont walk away from their education more of them walk the stage to get their diploma when students are not allowed to drop out they do better so tonight i am proposing that every stateevery staterequires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18  when kids do graduate the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college at a time when americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt this congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in july  extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle class families thousands of dollars and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of workstudy jobs in the next 5 years  of course its not enough for us to increase student aid we cant just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition well run out of money states also need to do their part by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets and colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down  recently i spoke with a group of college presidents who have done just that some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly some use better technology the point is its possible so let me put colleges and universities on notice if you cant stop tuition from going up the funding you get from taxpayers will go down higher education cant be a luxury it is an economic imperative that every family in america should be able to afford  lets also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented hard working students in this country face another challenge the fact that they arent yet american citizens many were brought here as small children are american through and through yet they live every day with the threat of deportation others came more recently to study business and science and engineering but as soon as they get their degree we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else that doesnt make sense  i believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration thats why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before thats why there are fewer illegal crossings than when i took office the opponents of action are out of excuses we should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now  but if electionyear politics keeps congress from acting on a comprehensive plan lets at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs start new businesses defend this country send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship i will sign it right away  you see an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country that means women should earn equal pay for equal work it means we should support everyone whos willing to work and every risk taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next steve jobs  after all innovation is what america has always been about most new jobs are created in startups and small businesses so lets pass an agenda that helps them succeed tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs both parties agree on these ideas so put them in a bill and get it on my desk this year  innovation also demands basic research today the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched new lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet dont gut these investments in our budget dont let other countries win the race for the future support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the internet to new american jobs and new american industries  and nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in americanmade energy over the last 3 years weve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration and tonight im directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources right nowright nowamerican oil production is the highest that its been in 8 years thats right 8 years not only that last year we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years  but with only 2 percent of the worlds oil reserves oil isnt enough this country needs an allout alloftheabove strategy that develops every available source of american energy a strategy thats cleaner cheaper and full of new jobs  we have a supply of natural gas that can last america nearly 100 years and my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy experts believe this will support more than 600000 jobs by the end of the decade and im requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use because america will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk  the development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper proving that we dont have to choose between our environment and our economy and by the way it was public research dollars over the course of 30 years that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground  now whats true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy in 3 years our partnership with the private sector has already positioned america to be the worlds leading manufacturer of hightech batteries because of federal investments renewable energy use has nearly doubled and thousands of americans have jobs because of it  when bryan ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture he said he worried that at 55 no one would give him a second chance but he found work at energetx a wind turbine manufacturer in michigan before the recession the factory only made luxury yachts today its hiring workers like bryan who said im proud to be working in the industry of the future  our experience with shale gas our experience with natural gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments dont always come right away some technologies dont pan out some companies fail but i will not walk away from the promise of clean energy i will not walk away from workers like bryan i will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to china or germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here  weve subsidized oil companies for a century thats long enough its time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable and double down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising pass clean energy tax credits create these jobs  we can also spur energy innovation with new incentives the differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change but theres no reason why congress shouldnt at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation so far you havent acted well tonight i will im directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes and im proud to announce that the department of defense working with us the worlds largest consumer of energy will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history with the navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year  of course the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy so heres a proposal help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings their energy bills will be a hundred billion dollars lower over the next decade and america will have less pollution more manufacturing more jobs for construction workers who need them send me a bill that creates these jobs  building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair americas infrastructure so much of america needs to be rebuilt weve got crumbling roads and bridges a power grid that wastes too much energy an incomplete highspeed broadband network that prevents a smallbusiness owner in rural america from selling her products all over the world  during the great depression america built the hoover dam and the golden gate bridge after world war ii we connected our states with a system of highways democratic and republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today  in the next few weeks i will sign an executive order clearing away the redtape that slows down too many construction projects but you need to fund these projects take the money were no longer spending at war use half of it to pay down our debt and use the rest to do some nationbuilding right here at home  theres never been a better time to build especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst of course construction workers werent the only ones who were hurt so were millions of innocent americans whove seen their home values decline and while government cant fix the problem on its own responsible homeowners shouldnt have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief  and thats why im sending this congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about 3000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low rates no more redtape no more runaround from the banks a small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it wont add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust  lets never forget millions of americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same its time to apply the same rules from top to bottom no bailouts no handouts and no copouts an america built to last insists on responsibility from everybody  weve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldnt afford them and buyers who knew they couldnt afford them thats why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices these dont destroy the free market they make the free market work better  theres no question that some regulations are outdated unnecessary or too costly in fact ive approved fewer regulations in the first 3 years of my presidency than my republican predecessor did in his ive ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that dont make sense weve already announced over 500 reforms and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than 10 billion over the next 5 years we got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend 10000 a year proving that they could contain a spill because milk was somehow classified as an oil with a rule like that i guess it was worth crying over spilled milk laughter  now im confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder absolutely but i will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the gulf 2 years ago i will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean i will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy deny your coverage or charge women differently than men  and i will not go back to the days when wall street was allowed to play by its own set of rules the new rules we passed restore what should be any financial systems core purpose getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home or start a business or send their kids to college  so if you are a big bank or financial institution youre no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers deposits youre required to write out a living will that details exactly how youll pay the bills if you fail because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again and if youre a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company the days of signing people up for products they cant afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices those days are over today american consumers finally have a watchdog in richard cordray with one job to look out for them  well also establish a financial crimes unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on largescale fraud and protect peoples investments some financial firms violate major antifraud laws because theres no real penalty for being a repeat offender thats bad for consumers and its bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing so pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count  and tonight im asking my attorney general to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis this new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law speed assistance to homeowners and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many americans  now a return to the american values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy but it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future  right now our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on a hundred and sixty million working americans while the recovery is still fragile people cannot afford losing 40 out of each paycheck this year there are plenty of ways to get this done so lets agree right here right now no side issues no drama pass the payroll tax cut without delay lets get it done  when it comes to the deficit weve already agreed to more than 2 trillion in cuts and savings but we need to do more and that means making choices right now were poised to spend nearly 1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans right now because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households right now warren buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary  do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest americans or do we want to keep our investments in everything else like education and medical research a strong military and care for our veterans because if were serious about paying down our debt we cant do both  the american people know what the right choice is so do i as i told the speaker this summer im prepared to make more reforms that rein in the longterm costs of medicare and medicaid and strengthen social security so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors but in return we need to change our tax code so that people like me and an awful lot of members of congress pay our fair share of taxes  tax reform should follow the buffett rule if you make more than a million dollars a year you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes and my republican friend tom coburn is right washington should stop subsidizing millionaires in fact if youre earning a million dollars a year you shouldnt get special tax subsidies or deductions on the other hand if you make under 250000 a year like 98 percent of american families your taxes shouldnt go up youre the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages youre the ones who need relief  now you can call this class warfare all you want but asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes most americans would call that common sense  we dont begrudge financial success in this country we admire it when americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes its not because they envy the rich its because they understand that when i get a tax break i dont need and the country cant afford it either adds to the deficit or somebody else has to make up the difference like a senior on a fixed income or a student trying to get through school or a family trying to make ends meet thats not right americans know thats not right they know that this generations success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other and to the future of their country and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility thats how well reduce our deficit thats an america built to last  now i recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt energy and health care but no matter what party they belong to i bet most americans are thinking the same thing right about now nothing will get done in washington this year or next year or maybe even the year after that because washington is broken  can you blame them for feeling a little cynical  the greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didnt come from events beyond our control it came from a debate in washington over whether the united states would pay its bills or not who benefited from that fiasco  ive talked tonight about the deficit of trust between main street and wall street but the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad and it seems to get worse every year  now some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics so together lets take some steps to fix that send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of congress i will sign it tomorrow lets limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact lets make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for congress cant lobby congress and vice versa an idea that has bipartisan support at least outside of washington  some of whats broken has to do with the way congress does its business these days a simple majority is no longer enough to get anythingeven routine businesspassed through the senate neither party has been blameless in these tactics now both parties should put an end to it for starters i ask the senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple upordown vote within 90 days  the executive branch also needs to change too often its inefficient outdated and remote thats why ive asked this congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our government is leaner quicker and more responsive to the needs of the american people  finally none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town we need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around commonsense ideas  im a democrat but i believe what republican abraham lincoln believed that government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves and no more thats why my education reform offers more competition and more control for schools and states thats why were getting rid of regulations that dont work thats why our health care law relies on a reformed private market not a government program  on the other hand even my republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads and clean energy projects and federal offices for the folks back home  the point is we should all want a smarter more effective government and while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year we can make real progress with or without this congress i will keep taking actions that help the economy grow but i can do a whole lot more with your help because when we act together theres nothing the united states of america cant achieve  thats the lesson weve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years ending the iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies from pakistan to yemen the al qaida operatives who remain are scrambling knowing that they cant escape the reach of the united states of america  from this position of strength weve begun to wind down the war in afghanistan ten thousand of our troops have come home twentythree thousand more will leave by the end of this summer this transition to afghan lead will continue and we will build an enduring partnership with afghanistan so that it is never again a source of attacks against america  as the tide of war recedes a wave of change has washed across the middle east and north africa from tunis to cairo from sanaa to tripoli a year ago qadhafi was one of the worlds longest serving dictators a murderer with american blood on his hands today he is gone and in syria i have no doubt that the asad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed and that human dignity cannot be denied  how this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain but we have a huge stake in the outcome and while its ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well we will stand against violence and intimidation we will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings men and women christians muslims and jews we will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets because tyranny is no match for liberty  and we will safeguard americas own security against those who threaten our citizens our friends and our interests look at iran through the power of our diplomacy a world that was once divided about how to deal with irans nuclear program now stands as one the regime is more isolated than ever before its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions and as long as they shirk their responsibilities this pressure will not relent  let there be no doubt america is determined to prevent iran from getting a nuclear weapon and i will take no options off the table to achieve that goal but a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible and far better and if iran changes course and meets its obligations it can rejoin the community of nations  the renewal of american leadership can be felt across the globe our oldest alliances in europe and asia are stronger than ever our ties to the americas are deeper our ironclad commitmentand i mean ironcladto israels security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history  weve made it clear that america is a pacific power and a new beginning in burma has lit a new hope from the coalitions weve built to secure nuclear materials to the missions weve led against hunger and disease from the blows weve dealt to our enemies to the enduring power of our moral example america is back  anyone who tells you otherwise anyone who tells you that america is in decline or that our influence has waned doesnt know what theyre talking about thats not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us thats not how people feel from tokyo to berlin from cape town to rio where opinions of america are higher than theyve been in years yes the world is changing no we cant control every event but america remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs and as long as im president i intend to keep it that way  thats why working with our military leaders ive proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget to stay one step ahead of our adversaries ive already sent this congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber threats  above all our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it as they come home we must serve them as well as theyve served us that includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned which is why weve increased annual va spending every year ive been president and it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation  with the bipartisan support of this congress were providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets michelle and jill biden have worked with american businesses to secure a pledge of 135000 jobs for veterans and their families and tonight im proposing a veterans jobs corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters so that america is as strong as those who defend her  which brings me back to where i began those of us whove been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops when you put on that uniform it doesnt matter if youre black or white asian latino native american conservative liberal rich poor gay straight when youre marching into battle you look out for the person next to you or the mission fails when youre in the thick of the fight you rise or fall as one unit serving one nation leaving no one behind  you know one of my proudest possessions is the flag that the seal team took with them on the mission to get bin laden on it are each of their names some may be democrats some may be republicans but that doesnt matter just like it didnt matter that day in the situation room when i sat next to bob gates a man who was george bushs defense secretary and hillary clinton a woman who ran against me for president  all that mattered that day was the mission no one thought about politics no one thought about themselves one of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didnt deserve credit for the mission it only succeeded he said because every single member of that unit did their job the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control the translator who kept others from entering the compound the troops who separated the women and children from the fight the seals who charged up the stairs more than that the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other because you cant charge up those stairs into darkness and danger unless you know that theres somebody behind you watching your back  so it is with america each time i look at that flag im reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes no one built this country on their own this nation is great because we built it together this nation is great because we worked as a team this nation is great because we get each others backs and if we hold fast to that truth in this moment of trial there is no challenge too great no mission too hard as long as we are joined in common purpose as long as we maintain our common resolve our journey moves forward and our future is hopeful and the state of our union will always be strong  thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america   
220, Address Before a Joint Session of Congress on the State of the Union, Barack Obama,2013-02-12,   please everybody have a seat mr speaker mr vice president members of congress fellow americans fiftyone years ago john f kennedy declared to this chamber that the constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress it is my task he said to report the state of the union to improve it is the task of us all  tonight thanks to the grit and determination of the american people there is much progress to report after a decade of grinding war our brave men and women in uniform are coming home after years of grueling recession our businesses have created over 6 million new jobs we buy more american cars than we have in 5 years and less foreign oil than we have in 20 our housing market is healing our stock market is rebounding and consumers patients and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before  so together we have cleared away the rubble of crisis and we can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger  but we gather here knowing that there are millions of americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded our economy is adding jobs but too many people still cant find fulltime employment corporate profits have skyrocketed to alltime highs but for more than a decade wages and incomes have barely budged  it is our generations task then to reignite the true engine of americas economic growth a rising thriving middle class  it is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities you can get ahead no matter where you come from no matter what you look like or who you love  it is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many and not just the few that it encourages free enterprise rewards individual initiative and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation  the american people dont expect government to solve every problem they dont expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue but they do expect us to put the nations interests before party they do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can for they know that america moves forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all  now our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery  over the last few years both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than 25 trillion mostly through spending cuts but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of americans as a result we are more than halfway towards the goal of 4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances  now we need to finish the job and the question is how  in 2011 congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldnt agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal about a trillion dollars worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year these sudden harsh arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness theyd devastate priorities like education and energy and medical research they would certainly slow our recovery and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs and thats why democrats republicans business leaders and economists have already said that these cuts known here in washington as the sequesterare a really bad idea  now some in congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training medicare and social security benefits that idea is even worse  yes the biggest driver of our longterm debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population and those of us who care deeply about programs like medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms otherwise our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations  but we cant ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful we wont grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters most americansdemocrats republicans and independentsunderstand that we cant just cut our way to prosperity they know that broadbased economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction with spending cuts and revenue and with everybody doing their fair share and thats the approach i offer tonight  on medicare im prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan simpsonbowles commission  already the affordable care act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs and the reforms im proposing go even further well reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors well bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for medicare because our medical bills shouldnt be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive and i am open to additional reforms from both parties so long as they dont violate the guarantee of a secure retirement our government shouldnt make promises we cannot keep but we must keep the promises weve already made  to hit the rest of our deficit reduction target we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the welloff and the wellconnected after all why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks how is that fair why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in social security benefits but not closing some loopholes how does that promote growth  now is our best chance for bipartisan comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit we can get this done the american people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and hiring a tax code that ensures billionaires with high powered accountants cant work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the united states of america thats what tax reform can deliver thats what we can do together  i realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy the politics will be hard for both sides none of us will get a hundred percent of what we want but the alternative will cost us jobs hurt our economy visit hardship on millions of hardworking americans so lets set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future and lets do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors the greatest nation on earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next we cant do it  lets agree right here right now to keep the peoples government open and pay our bills on time and always uphold the full faith and credit of the united states of america the american people have worked too hard for too long rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another  now most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda but lets be clear deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan a growing economy that creates good middle class jobs that must be the north star that guides our efforts every day we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation how do we attract more jobs to our shores how do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs and how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living  now a year and a half ago i put forward an american jobs act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs and i thank the last congress for passing some of that agenda i urge this congress to pass the rest but tonight ill lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago let me repeat nothing im proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime it is not a bigger government we need but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broadbased growth thats what we should be looking for  our first priority is making america a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing after shedding jobs for more than 10 years our manufacturers have added about 500000 jobs over the past 3 caterpillar is bringing jobs back from japan ford is bringing jobs back from mexico and this year apple will start making macs in america again  there are things we can do right now to accelerate this trend last year we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in youngstown ohio a onceshuttered warehouse is now a stateoftheart lab where new workers are mastering the 3d printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything theres no reason this cant happen in other towns  so tonight im announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs where businesses will partner with the department of defense and energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of hightech jobs and i ask this congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in america we can get that done  now if we want to make the best products we also have to invest in the best ideas every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned 140 to our economyevery dollar today our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to alzheimers theyre developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs devising new materials to make batteries 10 times more powerful now is not the time to gut these jobcreating investments in science and innovation now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the space race we need to make those investments  today no area holds more promise than our investments in american energy after years of talking about it were finally poised to control our own energy future we produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years we have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar with tens of thousands of good american jobs to show for it we produce more natural gas than ever before and nearly everyones energy bill is lower because of it and over the last 4 years our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen  but for the sake of our children and our future we must do more to combat climate change now its true that no single event makes a trend but the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15 heat waves droughts wildfires floodsall are now more frequent and more intense we can choose to believe that superstorm sandy and the most severe drought in decades and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before its too late  now the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth i urge this congress to get together pursue a bipartisan marketbased solution to climate change like the one john mccain and joe lieberman worked on together a few years ago but if congress wont act soon to protect future generations i will i will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy  and 4 years ago other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it and weve begun to change that last year wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in america so lets generate even more solar energy gets cheaper by the year lets drive down costs even further as long as countries like china keep going all in on clean energy so must we  now in the meantime the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence we need to encourage that and thats why my administration will keep cutting redtape and speeding up new oil and gas permits thats got to be part of an alloftheabove plan but i also want to work with this congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water  in fact much of our newfound energy is drawn from lands and waters that we the public own together so tonight i propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an energy security trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good if a nonpartisan coalition of ceos and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea then so can we lets take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices weve put up with for far too long  im also issuing a new goal for america lets cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years well work with the states to do it those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen  americas energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair ask any ceo where theyd rather locate and hire a country with deteriorating roads and bridges or one with high speed rail and internet hightech schools selfhealing power grids the ceo of siemens americaa company that brought hundreds of new jobs to north carolinasaid that if we upgrade our infrastructure theyll bring even more jobs and thats the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world and i know you want these jobcreating projects in your district ive seen all those ribboncuttings laughter  so tonight i propose a fixitfirst program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs like the nearly 70000 structurally deficient bridges across the country and to make sure taxpayers dont shoulder the whole burden im also proposing a partnership to rebuild america that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most modern ports to move our goods modern pipelines to withstand a storm modern schools worthy of our children lets prove theres no better place to do business than here in the united states of america and lets start right away we can get this done  and part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector the good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007 home prices are rising at the fastest pace in 6 years home purchases are up nearly 50 percent and construction is expanding again  but even with mortgage rates near a 50year low too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no thats holding our entire economy back we need to fix it  right now theres a bill in this congress that would give every responsible homeowner in america the chance to save 3000 a year by refinancing at todays rates democrats and republicans have supported it before so what are we waiting for take a vote and send me that bill why arewhy would we be against that why would that be a partisan issue helping folks refinance right now overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home whats holding us back lets streamline the process and help our economy grow  these initiatives in manufacturing energy infrastructure housing all these things will help entrepreneurs and smallbusiness owners expand and create new jobs but none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs  and that has to start at the earliest possible age study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning the better he or she does down the road but today fewer than 3 in 10 4yearolds are enrolled in a highquality preschool program most middle class parents cant afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool and for poor kids who need help the most this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives so tonight i propose working with states to make highquality preschool available to every single child in america thats something we should be able to do  every dollar we invest in highquality early childhood education can save more than 7 dollars later on by boosting graduation rates reducing teen pregnancy even reducing violent crime in states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children like georgia or oklahoma studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level graduate high school hold a job form more stable families of their own we know this works so lets do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind lets give our kids that chance  lets also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job right now countries like germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges so those german kids theyre ready for a job when they graduate high school theyve been trained for the jobs that are there now at schools like ptech in brooklyn a collaboration between new york public schools and city university of new york and ibm students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associates degree in computers or engineering we need to give every american student opportunities like this  and 4 years ago we started race to the top a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year tonight im announcing a new challenge to redesign americas high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a hightech economy and well reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers and create classes that focus on science technology engineering and math the skills todays employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future  now even with better high schools most young people will need some higher education its a simple fact the more education youve got the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class but today skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education or saddle them with unsustainable debt  through tax credits grants and better loans weve made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years but taxpayers cant keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education colleges must do their part to keep costs down and its our job to make sure that they do  so tonight i ask congress to change the higher education act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid and tomorrow my administration will release a new college scorecard that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criterion where you can get the most bang for your educational buck  now to grow our middle class our citizens have to have access to the education and training that todays jobs require but we also have to make sure that america remains a place where everyone whos willing to workeverybody whos willing to work hardhas the chance to get ahead  our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving hopeful immigrants and right now leaders from the business labor law enforcement faith communities they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform now is the time to do it now is the time to get it done applause now is the time to get it done  real reform means stronger border security and we can build on the progress my administration has already made putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years  real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship a path that includes passing a background check paying taxes and a meaningful penalty learning english and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally  and real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy  in other words we know what needs to be done and as we speak bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill and i applaud their efforts so lets get this done send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months and i will sign it right away and america will be better for it lets get it done applause lets get it done  but we cant stop there we know our economy is stronger when our wives our mothers our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace and free from the fear of domestic violence today the senate passed the violence against womens act that joe biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago and i now urge the house to do the same good job joe and i ask this congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts and finally pass the paycheck fairness act this year  we know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest days work with honest wages but today a fulltime worker making the minimum wage earns 14500 a year even with the tax relief we put in place a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line thats wrong thats why since the last time this congress raised the minimum wage 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher  tonight lets declare that in the wealthiest nation on earth no one who works fulltime should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to 9 an hour we should be able to get that done  this single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families it could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank rent or eviction scraping by or finally getting ahead for businesses across the country it would mean customers with more money in their pockets and a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government in fact working folks shouldnt have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while ceo pay has never been higher so heres an idea that governor romney and i actually agreed on last year lets tie the minimum wage to the cost of living so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on  tonight lets also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work it is virtually impossible to get ahead factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up inescapable pockets of poverty urban and rural where young adults are still fighting for their first job america is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny and thats why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them  lets offer incentives to companies that hire americans whove got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore lets put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in rundown neighborhoods and this year my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest hit towns in america to get these communities back on their feet now well work with local leaders to target resources at public safety and education and housing  well give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest and well work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for lowincome couples and do more to encourage fatherhood because what makes you a man isnt the ability to conceive a child its having the courage to raise one and we want to encourage that we want to help that  stronger families stronger communities a stronger america it is this kind of prosperitybroad shared built on a thriving middle classthat has always been the source of our progress at home its also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world  tonight we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us because of them we can say with confidence that america will complete its mission in afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al qaida  already we have brought home 33000 of our brave service men and women this spring our forces will move into a support role while afghan security forces take the lead tonight i can announce that over the next year another 34000 american troops will come home from afghanistan this drawdown will continue and by the end of next year our war in afghanistan will be over  beyond 2014 americas commitment to a unified and sovereign afghanistan will endure but the nature of our commitment will change were negotiating an agreement with the afghan government that focuses on two missions training and equipping afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al qaida and their affiliates  today the organization that attacked us on 911 is a shadow of its former self its true different al qaida affiliates and extremist groups have emerged from the arabian peninsula to africa the threat these groups pose is evolving but to meet this threat we dont need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations instead well need to help countries like yemen and libya and somalia provide for their own security and help allies who take the fight to terrorists as we have in mali and where necessary through a range of capabilities we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to americans  now as we do we must enlist our values in the fight thats why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts throughout we have kept congress fully informed of our efforts i recognize that in our democracy no one should just take my word for it that were doing things the right way so in the months ahead i will continue to engage congress to ensure not only that our targeting detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances but that our efforts are even more transparent to the american people and to the world  of course our challenges dont end with al qaida america will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the worlds most dangerous weapons the regime in north korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them as we stand by our allies strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats  likewise the leaders of iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon  at the same time well engage russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations  america must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber attacks now we know hackers steal peoples identities and infiltrate private emails we know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid our financial institutions our air traffic control systems we cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy  and thats why earlier today i signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing and developing standards to protect our national security our jobs and our privacy  but now congress must act as well by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks this is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis  now even as we protect our people we should remember that todays world presents not just dangers not just threats it presents opportunities to boost american exports support american jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of asia we intend to complete negotiations on a transpacific partnership and tonight im announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the european union because trade that is fair and free across the atlantic supports millions of good paying american jobs  we also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all not only because it creates new markets more stable order in certain regions of the world but also because its the right thing to do in many places people live on little more than a dollar a day so the united states will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy by empowering women by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to feed and power and educate themselves by saving the worlds children from preventable deaths and by realizing the promise of an aidsfree generation which is within our reach  you see america must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change i saw the power of hope last year in rangoon in burma when aung san suu kyi welcomed an american president into the home where she had been imprisoned for years when thousands of burmese lined the streets waving american flags including a man who said there is justice and law in the united states i want our country to be like that  in defense of freedom well remain the anchor of strong alliances from the americas to africa from europe to asia in the middle east we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights and support stable transitions to democracy  we know the process will be messy and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like egypt but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people well keep the pressure on a syrian regime that has murdered its own people and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every syrian and we will stand steadfast with israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace  these are the messages ill deliver when i travel to the middle east next month and all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk our diplomats our intelligence officers and the men and women of the united states armed forces as long as im commander in chief we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known  well invest in new capabilities even as we reduce waste and wartime spending we will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers and equal benefits for their families gay and straight we will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat  we will keep faith with our veterans investing in worldclass care including mental health carefor our wounded warriors supporting our military families giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned and i want to thank my wife michelle and dr jill biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us thank you honey thank you jill  defending our freedom though is not just the job of our military alone we must all do our part to make sure our godgiven rights are protected here at home that includes one of the most fundamental rights of a democracy the right to vote now when any american no matter where they live or what their party are denied that right because they cant afford to wait for 5 or 6 or 7 hours just to cast their ballot we are betraying our ideals  so tonight im announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in america and it definitely needs improvement im asking two longtime experts in the fieldwho by the way recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for governor romneys campaignto lead it we can fix this and we will the american people demand it and so does our democracy  of course what ive said tonight matters little if we dont come together to protect our most precious resource our children it has been 2 months since newtown i know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence but this time is different overwhelming majorities of americansamericans who believe in the second amendmenthave come together around commonsense reform like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets because these police chiefs theyre tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned  each of these proposals deserves a vote in congress now if you want to vote no thats your choice but these proposals deserve a vote because in the 2 months since newtown more than a thousand birthdays graduations anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gunmore than a thousand  one of those we lost was a young girl named hadiya pendleton she was 15 years old she loved fig newtons and lip gloss she was a majorette she was so good to her friends they all thought they were her best friend just 3 weeks ago she was here in washington with her classmates performing for her country at my inauguration and a week later she was shot and killed in a chicago park after school just a mile away from my house  hadiyas parents nate and cleo are in this chamber tonight along with more than two dozen americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence they deserve a vote they deserve a vote applause they deserve a vote gabby giffords deserves a vote the families of newtown deserve a vote the families of aurora deserve a vote the families of oak creek and tucson and blacksburg and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence they deserve a simple vote they deserve a simple vote  our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country in fact no laws no initiatives no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges ive outlined tonight but we were never sent here to be perfect we were sent here to make what difference we can to secure this nation expand opportunity uphold our ideals through the hard often frustrating but absolutely necessary work of selfgovernment  we were sent here to look out for our fellow americans the same way they look out for one another every single day usually without fanfare all across this country we should follow their example  we should follow the example of a new york city nurse named menchu sanchez when hurricane sandy plunged her hospital into darkness she wasnt thinking about how her own home was faring her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe  we should follow the example of a north miami woman named desiline victor when desiline arrived at her polling place she was told the wait to vote might be 6 hours and as time ticked by her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet but whether folks like her would get to have their say and hour after hour a throng of people stayed in line to support her because desiline is 102 years old and they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read i voted applause theres desiline  we should follow the example of a police officer named brian murphy when a gunman opened fire on a sikh temple in wisconsin and brian was the first to arriveand he did not consider his own safety he fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the americans worshiping inside even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds and when asked how he did that brian said thats just the way were made  thats just the way were made we may do different jobs and wear different uniforms and hold different views than the person beside us but as americans we all share the same proud title we are citizens its a word that doesnt just describe our nationality or legal status it describes the way were made it describes what we believe it captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others and that well into our third century as a nation it remains the task of us all as citizens of these united states to be the authors of the next great chapter of our american story  thank you god bless you and god bless these united states of america   
221, Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union, Barack Obama,2014-01-28,   the president mr speaker mr vice president members of congress my fellow americans today in america a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it and did her part to lift americas graduation rate to its highest levels in more than three decades an entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup and did her part to add to the more than 8 million new jobs our businesses have created over the past 4 years an autoworker finetuned some of the best most fuel efficient cars in the world and did his part to help america wean itself off foreign oil  a farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest 5year stretch of farm exports in our history a rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford a man took the bus home from the graveyard shift bonetired but dreaming big dreams for his son and in tightknit communities all across america fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids put an arm around their spouse remember fallen comrades and give thanks for being home from a war that after 12 long years is finally coming to an end  tonight this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent it is you our citizens who make the state of our union strong  and here are the results of your efforts the lowest unemployment rate in over 5 years a rebounding housing market a manufacturing sector thats adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world the first time thats happened in nearly 20 years our deficits cut by more than half and for the first time in over a decade business leaders around the world have declared that china is no longer the worlds numberone place to invest america is  thats why i believe this can be a breakthrough year for america after 5 years of grit and determined effort the united states is better positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on earth  the question for everyone in this chamber running through every decision we make this year is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress for several years now this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government its an important debate one that dates back to our very founding but when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracywhen our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the united statesthen we are not doing right by the american people  now as president im committed to making washington work better and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here and i believe most of you are too last month thanks to the work of democrats and republicans congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last years severe cuts to priorities like education nobody got everything they wanted and we can still do more to invest in this countrys future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way but the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs not creating new crises  and in the coming months lets see where else we can make progress together lets make this a year of action thats what most americans want for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives their hopes their aspirations and what i believe unites the people of this nationregardless of race or region or party young or old rich or pooris the simple profound belief in opportunity for all the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility you can get ahead in america  now lets face it that belief has suffered some serious blows over more than three decades even before the great recession hit massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good middle class jobs and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on  today after 4 years of economic growth corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher and those at the top have never done better but average wages have barely budged inequality has deepened upward mobility has stalled the cold hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery too many americans are working more than ever just to get by let alone to get ahead and too many still arent working at all  so our job is to reverse these trends it wont happen right away and we wont agree on everything but what i offer tonight is a set of concrete practical proposals to speed up growth strengthen the middle class and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class some require congressional action and i am eager to work with all of you but america does not stand still and neither will i so wherever and whenever i can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more american families thats what im going to do  as usual our first lady sets a good example applause well applause michelles lets move partnership with schools businesses local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in 30 years and thats an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come the joining forces alliance that michelle and jill biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400000 veterans and military spouses  taking a page from that playbook the white house just organized a college opportunity summit where already 150 universities businesses nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education and to help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus and across the country were partnering with mayors governors and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality  the point is there are millions of americans outside of washington who are tired of stale political arguments and are moving this country forward they believeand i believethat here in america our success should depend not on accident of birth but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams thats what drew our forebears here thats how the daughter of a factory worker is ceo of americas largest automaker how the son of a barkeep is speaker of the house how the son of a single mom can be president of the greatest nation on earth  opportunity is who we are and the defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise we know where to start the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job with the economy picking up speed companies say they intend to hire more people this year and over half of big manufacturers say theyre thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad  so lets make that decision easier for more companies both democrats and republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here and reward companies that keep profits abroad lets flip that equation lets work together to close those loopholes end those incentives to ship jobs overseas and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home  moreover we can take the money we save from this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads upgrading our ports unclogging our commutes because in todays global economy firstclass jobs gravitate to firstclass infrastructure well need congress to protect more than 3 million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer that can happen but ill act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible  we also have the chance right now to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of hightech manufacturing jobs my administration has launched two hubs for hightech manufacturing in raleigh north carolina and youngstown ohio where weve connected businesses to research universities that can help america lead the world in advanced technologies tonight im announcing well launch six more this year bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create so get those bills to my desk put more americans back to work  lets do more to help the entrepreneurs and smallbusiness owners who create most new jobs in america over the past 5 years my administration has made more loans to smallbusiness owners than any other and when 98 percent of our exporters are small businesses new trade partnerships with europe and asiathe asiapacific will help them create more jobs we need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers protect our environment and open new markets to new goods stamped made in the usa  listen china and europe arent standing on the sidelines and neither should we we know that the nation that goes allin on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow this is an edge america cannot surrender federally funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind google and smartphones and thats why congress should undo the damage done by last years cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great american discovery there are entire industries to be built based on vaccines that stay ahead of drug resistant bacteria or paperthin material thats stronger than steel and lets pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation not costly and needless litigation  now one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to american energy the alloftheabove energy strategy i announced a few years ago is working and today america is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades  one of the reasons why is natural gas if extracted safely its the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change businesses plan to invest almost 100 billion in new factories that use natural gas ill cut redtape to help states get those factories built and put folks to work and this congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to american natural gas  meanwhile my administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and jobs growth while strengthening protection of our air our water our communities and while were at it ill use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations  well its not just oil and natural gas production thats booming were becoming a global leader in solar too every 4 minutes another american home or business goes solar every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job cannot be outsourced lets continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving 4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that dont need it so we can invest more in fuels of the future that do  and even as weve increased energy production weve partnered with businesses builders and local communities to reduce the energy we consume when we rescued our automakers for example we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars in the coming months ill build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump  and taken together our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner safer planet over the past 8 years the united states has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth but we have to act with more urgency because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with floods thats why i directed my administration to work with states utilities and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air  the shift to a cleaner energy economy wont happen overnight and it will require some tough choices along the way but the debate is settled climate change is a fact and when our childrens children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer more stable world with new sources of energy i want us to be able to say yes we did  finally if were serious about economic growth it is time to heed the call of business leaders labor leaders faith leaders law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system republicans and democrats in the senate have acted and i know that members of both parties in the house want to do the same independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost 1 trillion in the next two decades and for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dreamsto study invent contribute to our culturethey make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everybody so lets get immigration reform done this year applause lets get it done its time  the ideas ive outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs but in this rapidly changing economy we have to make sure that every american has the skills to fill those jobs the good news is we know how to do it  two years ago as the auto industry came roaring back andra rush opened up a manufacturing firm in detroit she knew that ford needed parts for the best selling truck in america and she knew how to make those parts she just needed the workforce so she dialed up what we call an american job center places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job or a better job she was flooded with new workers and today detroit manufacturing systems has more than 700 employees and what andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer and every job seeker  so tonight ive asked vice president biden to lead an acrosstheboard reform of americas training programs to make sure they have one mission train americans with the skills employers need and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now that means more onthe job training and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life it means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs and if congress wants to help you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more readytowork americans with readytobe filled jobs  im also convinced we can help americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that its more effective in todays economy but first this congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 16 million people  let me tell you why misty demars is a mother of two young boys shed been steadily employed since she was a teenager put herself through college shed never collected unemployment benefits but shed been paying taxes in may she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home a week later budget cuts claimed the job she loved last month when their unemployment insurance was cut off she sat down and wrote me a letter the kind i get every day we are the face of the unemployment crisis she wrote im not dependent on the government our country depends on people like us who build careers contribute to society care about our neighbors im confident that in time i will find a job i will pay my taxes and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love please give us this chance  congress give these hardworking responsible americans that chance give them that chance applause give them the chance they need our help right now but more important this country needs them in the game thats why ive been asking ceos to give more longterm unemployed workers a fair shot at new jobs a new chance to support their families and in fact this week many will come to the white house to make that commitment real tonight i ask every business leader in america to join us and to do the same because we are stronger when america fields a full team  of course its not enough to train todays workforce we also have to prepare tomorrows workforce by guaranteeing every child access to a worldclass education estiven rodriguez couldnt speak a word of english when he moved to new york city at age 9 but last month thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program he led a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors from their high school to the post office where they mailed off their college applications and this son of a factory worker just found out hes going to college this fall  five years ago we set out to change the odds for all our kids we worked with lenders to reform student loans and today more young people are earning college degrees than ever before race to the top with the help of governors from both parties has helped states raise expectations and performance teachers and principals in schools from tennessee to washington dc are making big strides in preparing students with the skills for the new economy problem solving critical thinking science technology engineering math  now some of this change is hard it requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test but it is worth it and it is working the problem is were still not reaching enough kids and were not reaching them in time and that has to change  research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a childs life is highquality early education last year i asked this congress to help states make highquality prek available to every 4 yearold and as a parent as well as a president i repeat that request tonight but in the meantime 30 states have raised prek funding on their own they know we cant wait so just as we worked with states to reform our schools this year well invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children and as congress decides what its going to do im going to pull together a coalition of elected officials business leaders and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high quality prek that they need it is right for america we need to get this done  last year i also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to highspeed broadband over the next 4 years tonight i can announce that with the support of the fcc and companies like apple microsoft sprint and verizon weve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15000 schools and 20 million students over the next 2 years without adding a dime to the deficit  were working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the realworld education and handson training that can lead directly to a job and career were shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information and colleges more incentive to offer better value so that no middle class kid is priced out of a college education  were offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to 10 percent of their income and i want to work with congress to see how we can help even more americans who feel trapped by student loan debt and im reaching out to some of americas leading foundations and corporations on a new initiative to help more young men of color facing especially tough odds to stay on track and reach their full potential  the bottom line is michelle and i want every child to have the same chance this country gave us but we know our opportunity agenda wont be complete and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the american dream as an empty promise unless we also do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work and hard work pays off for every single american  today women make up about half our workforce but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns that is wrong and in 2014 its an embarrassment women deserve equal pay for equal work she deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job a mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or a sick parent without running into hardship and you know what a father does too it is time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a mad men episode laughter this year lets all come togethercongress the white house businesses from wall street to main streetto give every woman the opportunity she deserves because i believe when women succeed america succeeds  now women hold a majority of lower wage jobs but theyre not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages americans understand that some people will earn more money than others and we dont resent those who by virtue of their efforts achieve incredible success thats what america is all about but americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works fulltime should ever have to raise a family in poverty  in the year since i asked this congress to raise the minimum wage five states have passed laws to raise theirs many businesses have done it on their own nick chute is here today with his boss john soranno johns an owner of punch pizza in minneapolis and nick helps make the dough laughter only now he makes more of it laughter john just gave his employees a raise to 10 bucks an hour and thats a decision that has eased their financial stress and boosted their morale  tonight i ask more of americas business leaders to follow johns lead do what you can to raise your employees wages its good for the economy its good for america to every mayor governor state legislator in america i say you dont have to wait for congress to act americans will support you if you take this on  and as a chief executive i intend to lead by example profitable corporations like costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover we should too in the coming weeks i will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least 10 dollars and 10 cents an hour because if you cook our troops meals or wash their dishes you should not have to live in poverty  of course to reach millions more congress does need to get on board today the federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when ronald reagan first stood here and tom harkin and george miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to 10 dollars and 10 cents its easy to remember 1010 this will help families it will give businesses customers with more money to spend it does not involve any new bureaucratic program so join the rest of the country say yes give america a raise give them a raise  there are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the earnedincome tax credit right now it helps about half of all parents at some point think about that it helps about half of all parents in america at some point in their lives but i agree with republicans like senator rubio that it doesnt do enough for single workers who dont have kids so lets work together to strengthen the credit reward work help more americans get ahead  lets do more to help americans save for retirement today most workers dont have a pension a social security check often isnt enough on its own and while the stock market has doubled over the last 5 years that doesnt help folks who dont have 401ks thats why tomorrow i will direct the treasury to create a new way for working americans to start their own retirement savings myimyra  its a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg myra guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in and if this congress wants to help work with me to fix an upsidedown tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save but does little or nothing for middle class americans offer every american access to an automatic ira on the job so they can save at work just like everybody in this chamber can  and since the most important investment many families make is their home send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations  one last point on financial security for decades few things exposed hardworking families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system and in case you havent heard were in the process of fixing that now a preexisting condition used to mean that someone like amanda shelley a physicians assistant and single mom from arizona couldnt get health insurance but on january 1 she got covered on january 3 she felt a sharp pain on january 6 she had emergency surgery just one week earlier amanda said and that surgery would have meant bankruptcy  thats what health insurance reform is all about the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes you dont have to lose everything already because of the affordable care act more than 3 million americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents plan more than 9 million americans have signed up for private health insurance or medicaid coverage nine million  and heres another number zero because of this law no americannone zerocan ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma or back pain or cancer no woman can ever be charged more just because shes a woman and we did all this while adding years to medicares finances keeping medicare premiums flat and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors  now i do not expect to convince my republican friends on the merits of this law laughter but i know that the american people are not interested in refighting old battles so again if you have specific plans to cut costs cover more people increase choice tell america what youd do differently lets see if the numbers add up but lets not have another 40something votes to repeal a law thats already helping millions of americans like amanda the first 40 were plenty laughter  we all owe it to the american people to say what were for not just what were against and if you want to know the real impact this law is having just talk to governor steve beshear of kentucky whos here tonight now kentucky is not the most liberal part of the country thats not where i got my highest vote totals laughter but hes like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealths families theyre our neighbors and our friends he said theyre people we shop and go to church with farmers out on the tractor grocery clerks theyre people who go to work every morning praying they dont get sick no one deserves to live that way  steves right thats why tonight i ask every american who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by march 31 applause help them get covered moms get on your kids to sign up kids call your mom and walk her through the application it will give her some peace of mind and plus shell appreciate hearing from you laughter  after all thats the spirit that has always moved this nation forward its the spirit of citizenship the recognition that through hard work and responsibility we can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well  citizenship means standing up for everyones right to vote last year part of the voting rights act was weakened but conservative republicans and liberal democrats are working together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission i appointed chaired by my campaign lawyer and governor romneys campaign lawyer came together and have offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote lets support these efforts it should be the power of our vote not the size of our bank accounts that drives our democracy  citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day ive seen the courage of parents students pastors police officers all over this country who say we are not afraid and i intend to keep trying with or without congress to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent americans in our movie theaters in our shopping malls or schools like sandy hook  citizenship demands a sense of common purpose participation in the hard work of selfgovernment an obligation to serve our communities and i know this chamber agrees that few americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the united states armed forces thank you tonight because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free the united states is more secure when i took office nearly 180000 americans were serving in iraq and afghanistan today all our troops are out of iraq more than 60000 of our troops have already come home from afghanistan with afghan forces now in the lead for their own security our troops have moved to a support role together with our allies we will complete our mission there by the end of this year and americas longest war will finally be over  after 2014 we will support a unified afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future if the afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated a small force of americans could remain in afghanistan with nato allies to carry out two narrow missions training and assisting afghan forces and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al qaida for while our relationship with afghanistan will change one thing will not our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country  the fact is that danger remains while weve put al qaidas core leadership on a path to defeat the threat has evolved as al qaida affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world in yemen somalia iraq mali we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable those networks in syria well support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks here at home well keep strengthening our defenses and combat new threats like cyber attacks and as we reform our defense budget we will have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions  we have to remain vigilant but i strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our outstanding military alone as commander in chief i have used force when needed to protect the american people and i will never hesitate to do so as long as i hold this office but i will not send our troops into harms way unless it is truly necessary nor will i allow our sons and daughters to be mired in openended conflicts we must fight the battles that need to be fought not those that terrorists prefer from us largescale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism  so even as we actively and aggressively pursue terrorist networks through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners america must move off a permanent war footing thats why ive imposed prudent limits on the use of drones for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence  thats why working with this congress i will reform our surveillance programs because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence here and abroad that privacy of ordinary people is not being violated  and with the afghan war ending this needs to be the year congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at guantanamo bay because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military actions but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world  you see in a world of complex threats our security our leadership depends on all elements of our power including strong and principled diplomacy american diplomacy has rallied more than 50 countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpiles american diplomacy backed by the threat of force is why syrias chemical weapons are being eliminated  and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the syrian people deserve a future free of dictatorship terror and fear as we speak american diplomacy is supporting israelis and palestinians as they engage in the difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for palestinians and lasting peace and security for the state of israel a jewish state that knows america will always be at their side  and it is american diplomacy backed by pressure that has halted the progress of irans nuclear program and rolled back parts of that program for the very first time in a decade as we gather here tonight iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium its not installing advanced centrifuges unprecedented inspections help the world verify every day that iran is not building a bomb and with our allies and partners were engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share preventing iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon  these negotiations will be difficult they may not succeed we are clear eyed about irans support for terrorist organizations like hizballah which threatens our allies and were clear about the mistrust between our nations mistrust that cannot be wished away but these negotiations dont rely on trust any longterm deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that iran is not building a nuclear bomb if john f kennedy and ronald reagan could negotiate with the soviet union then surely a strong and confident america can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today  the sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible but let me be clear if this congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks i will veto it for the sake of our national security we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed if irans leaders do not seize this opportunity then i will be the first to call for more sanctions and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure iran does not build a nuclear weapon but if irans leaders do seize the chanceand well know soon enough then iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war  now finally lets remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe to forge greater cooperation to expand new markets to free people from fear and want and no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than america  our alliance with europe remains the strongest the world has ever known from tunisia to burma were supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy in ukraine we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and to have a say in their countrys future across africa were bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty in the americas were building new ties of commerce but were also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people and we will continue to focus on the asiapacific where we support our allies shape a future of greater security and prosperity and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster as we did in the philippines when our marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon and who were greeted with words like we will never forget your kindness and god bless america  we do these things because they help promote our longterm security and we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being regardless of race or religion creed or sexual orientation and next week the world will see one expression of that commitment when team usa marches the red white and blue into the olympic stadium and brings home the gold laughter  audience members usa usa usa  the president my fellow americans no other country in the world does what we do on every issue the world turns to us not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might but because of the ideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance them no one knows this better than those who serve in uniform  as this time of war draws to a close a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life well keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits theyve earned and our wounded warriors receive the health careincluding the mental health carethat they need well keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home and we will all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families  let me tell you about one of those families ive come to know i first met cory remsburg a proud army ranger at omaha beach on the 65th anniversary of dday along with some of his fellow rangers he walked me through the program and the ceremony he was a strong impressive young man had an easy manner he was sharp as a tack and we joked around and took pictures and i told him to stay in touch  a few months later on his 10th deployment cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in afghanistan his comrades found him in a canal face down underwater shrapnel in his brain for months he lay in a coma and the next time i met him in the hospital he couldnt speak could barely move over the years hes endured dozens of surgeries and procedures hours of grueling rehab every day  even now cory is still blind in one eye still struggles on his left side but slowly steadily with the support of caregivers like his dad craig and the community around him cory has grown stronger and day by day hes learned to speak again and stand again and walk again and hes working toward the day when he can serve his country again my recovery has not been easy he says nothing in life thats worth anything is easy cory is here tonight and like the army he loves like the america he serves sergeant first class cory remsburg never gives up and he does not quit cory  my fellow americans men and women like cory remind us that america has never come easy our freedom our democracy has never been easy sometimes we stumble we make mistakes we get frustrated or discouraged but for more than 200 years we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement to free other nations from tyranny and fear to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen the america we want for our kidsa rising america where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take usnone of it is easy but if we work togetherif we summon what is best in us the way cory summoned what is best in himwith our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast toward tomorrow i know it is within our reach believe it  god bless you and god bless the united states of america   
222, Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union, Barack Obama,2015-01-20,   the president mr speaker mr vice president members of congress my fellow americans we are 15 years into this new century fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world it has been and still is a hard time for many  but tonight we turn the page tonight after a breakthrough year for america our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999 our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis more of our kids are graduating than ever before more of our people are insured than ever before and we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as weve been in almost 30 years  tonight for the first time since 911 our combat mission in afghanistan is over six years ago nearly 180000 american troops served in iraq and afghanistan today fewer than 15000 remain and we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 911 generation who has served to keep us safe we are humbled and grateful for your service  america for all that we have endured for all the grit and hard work required to come back for all the tasks that lie ahead know this the shadow of crisis has passed and the state of the union is strong  at this momentwith a growing economy shrinking deficits bustling industry booming energy productionwe have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on earth its now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come  will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort  will we approach the world fearful and reactive dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing or will we lead wisely using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet  will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled america forward  in 2 weeks i will send this congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical not partisan and in the months ahead ill crisscross the country making a case for those ideas so tonight i want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us  it begins with our economy seven years ago rebekah and ben erler of minneapolis were newlyweds laughter she waited tables he worked construction their first child jack was on the way they were young and in love in america and it doesnt get much better than that if only we had known rebekah wrote to me last spring what was about to happen to the housing and construction market as the crisis worsened bens business dried up so he took what jobs he could find even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new career they sacrificed for each other and slowly it paid off they bought their first home they had a second son henry rebekah got a better job and then a raise ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night  it is amazing rebekah wrote what you can bounce back from when you have to    we are a strong tightknit family who has made it through some very very hard times we are a strong tightknit family who has made it through some very very hard times  america rebekah and bens story is our story they represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled you are the reason that i ran for this office you are the people i was thinking of 6 years ago today in the darkest months of the crisis when i stood on the steps of this capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation and it has been your resilience your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger  we believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores and over the past 5 years our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs  we believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet and today america is number one in oil and gas america is number one in wind power every 3 weeks we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008 and thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards the typical family this year should save about 750 at the pump  we believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world and today our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime high more americans finish college than ever before  we believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis shield families from ruin and encourage fair competition today we have new tools to stop taxpayerfunded bailouts and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices and in the past year alone about 10 million uninsured americans finally gained the security of health coverage  at every step we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious that we would crush jobs and explode deficits instead weve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade our deficits cut by two thirds a stock market that has doubled and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years this is good news people laughter  so the verdict is clear middle class economics works expanding opportunity works and these policies will continue to work as long as politics dont get in the way we cant slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns we cant put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on wall street or refighting past battles on immigration when weve got to fix a broken system and if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things i will veto it it will have earned my veto  today thanks to a growing economy the recovery is touching more and more lives wages are finally starting to rise again we know that more smallbusiness owners plan to raise their employees pay than at any time since 2007 but heres the thing those of us here tonight we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesnt screw things uplaughterthat government doesnt halt the progress were making we need to do more than just do no harm tonight together lets do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every american  because families like rebekahs still need our help she and ben are working as hard as ever but theyve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement friday night pizza thats a big splurge basic childcare for jack and henry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the university of minnesota like millions of hardworking americans rebekah isnt asking for a handout but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead  and in fact at every moment of economic change throughout our history this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot we set up worker protections social security medicare medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity we gave our citizens schools and colleges infrastructure and the internet tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them  thats what middle class economics is the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot everyone does their fair share everyone plays by the same set of rules we dont just want everyone to share in americas success we want everyone to contribute to our success  so what does middle class economics require in our time first middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change that means helping folks afford childcare college health care a home retirement and my budget will address each of these issues lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year  heres one example during world war ii when men like my grandfather went off to war having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority so this country provided universal childcare in todays economy when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families we need affordable highquality childcare more than ever  its not a nicetohave its a musthave so its time we stop treating childcare as a side issue or as a womens issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us and thats why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and lowincome family with young children in america by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to 3000 per child per year  heres another example today we are the only advanced country on earth that doesnt guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers fortythree million workers have no paid sick leave43 million think about that and that forces too many parents to make the gutwrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home so ill be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own and since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last november lets put it to a vote right here in washington send me a bill that gives every worker in america the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid sick leave its the right thing to do applause its the right thing to do  of course nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages thats why this congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work i mean its 2015 laughter its time we still need to make sure employees get the overtime theyve earned and to everyone in this congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage i say this if you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than 15000 a year try it if not vote to give millions of the hardest working people in america a raise  now these ideas wont make everybody rich wont relieve every hardship thats not the job of government to give working families a fair shot we still need more employers to see beyond next quarters earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their companys longterm interest we still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions and give american workers a voice  but you know things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wagethese ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families thats a fact and thats what all of us republicans and democrats alike were sent here to do  now second to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road we have to do more to help americans upgrade their skills america thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free sent a generation of gis to college trained the best workforce in the world we were ahead of the curve but other countries caught on and in a 21stcentury economy that rewards knowledge like never before we need to up our game we need to do more  by the end of this decade two in three job openings will require some higher educationtwo in three and yet we still live in a country where too many bright striving americans are priced out of the education they need its not fair to them and its sure not smart for our future and thats why im sending this congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero  keep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college some are young and starting out some are older and looking for a better job some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market whoever you are this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt understand youve got to earn it youve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time  tennessee a state with republican leadership and chicago a city with democratic leadership are showing that free community college is possible i want to spread that idea all across america so that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in america as high school is today lets stay ahead of the curve and i want to work with this congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesnt derail anyones dreams  thanks to vice president bidens great work to update our job training system were connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill highpaying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics tonight im also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like cvs and ups and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher paying jobs even if they dont have a higher education  and as a new generation of veterans comes home we owe them every opportunity to live the american dream they helped defend already weve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care were slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need and were making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs and joining forces the national campaign launched by michelle and jill bidenapplausethank you michelle thank you jillhas helped nearly 700000 veterans and military spouses get a new job so to every ceo in america let me repeat if you want somebody whos going to get the job done and done right hire a veteran  finally as we better train our workers we need the new economy to keep churning out highwage jobs for our workers to fill since 2010 america has put more people back to work than europe japan and all advanced economies combined  our manufacturers have added almost 800000 new jobs some of our bedrock sectors like our auto industry are booming but there are also millions of americans who work in jobs that didnt even exist 10 or 20 years ago jobs at companies like google and ebay and tesla  so no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future but we do know we want them here in america we know that and thats why the third part of middle class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere the place where businesses want to locate and hire  twentyfirst century businesses need 21stcentury infrastructure modern ports and stronger bridges faster trains and the fastest internet democrats and republicans used to agree on this so lets set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline lets pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come lets do it lets get it done applause lets get it done  twentyfirst century businesses including small businesses need to sell more american products overseas today our businesses export more than ever and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages but as we speak china wants to write the rules for the worlds fastest growing region that would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage why would we let that happen we should write those rules we should level the playing field and thats why im asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect american workers with strong new trade deals from asia to europe that arent just free but are also fair its the right thing to do  look im the first one to admit that past trade deals havent always lived up to the hype and thats why weve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense but 95 percent of the worlds customers live outside our borders we cant close ourselves off from those opportunities more than half of manufacturing executives have said theyre actively looking to bring jobs back from china so lets give them one more reason to get it done  twentyfirst century businesses will rely on american science and technology research and development i want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine one that delivers the right treatment at the right time  in some patients with cystic fibrosis this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable so tonight im launching a new precision medicine initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier we can do this  i intend to protect a free and open internet extend its reach to every classroom and every community and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world i want americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs converting sunlight into liquid fuel creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again pushing out into the solar system not just to visit but to stay last month we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send american astronauts to mars and in 2 months to prepare us for those missions scott kelly will begin a yearlong stay in space so good luck captain make sure to instagram it were proud of you  now the truth is when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research i know theres bipartisan support in this chamber members of both parties have told me so where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments as americans we dont mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too but for far too long lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight theyve riddled it with giveaways that the superrich dont need while denying a break to middle class families who do  this year we have an opportunity to change that lets close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those that invest here in america lets use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home lets simplify the system and let a smallbusiness owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford and lets close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth we can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college we need a tax code that truly helps working americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy and we can achieve that together applause we can achieve it together  helping hardworking families make ends meet giving them the tools they need for goodpaying jobs in this new economy maintaining the conditions of growth and competitivenessthis is where america needs to go i believe its where the american people want to go it will make our economy stronger a year from now 15 years from now and deep into the century ahead  of course if theres one thing this new century has taught us its that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores my first duty as commander in chief is to defend the united states of america in doing so the question is not whether america leads in the world but how when we make rash decisions reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer more prosperous world thats what our enemies want us to do  i believe in a smarter kind of american leadership we lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy when we leverage our power with coalition building when we dont let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents thats exactly what were doing right now and around the globe it is making a difference  first we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists from a school in pakistan to the streets of paris we will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks and we reserve the right to act unilaterally as we have done relentlessly since i took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies at the same time weve learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years instead of americans patrolling the valleys of afghanistan weve trained their security forces who have now taken the lead and weve honored our troops sacrifice by supporting that countrys first democratic transition instead of sending large ground forces overseas were partnering with nations from south asia to north africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten america  in iraq and syria american leadershipincluding our military poweris stopping isils advance instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the middle east we are leading a broad coalition including arab nations to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group were also supporting a moderate opposition in syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism  now this effort will take time it will require focus but we will succeed and tonight i call on this congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against isil we need that authority  second were demonstrating the power of american strength and diplomacy were upholding the principle that bigger nations cant bully the small by opposing russian aggression and supporting ukraines democracy and reassuring our nato allies  last year as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline states mr putins aggression it was suggested was a masterful display of strategy and strength thats what i heard from some folks laughter well today it is america that stands strong and united with our allies while russia is isolated with its economy in tatters thats how america leads not with bluster but with persistent steady resolve  in cuba we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date when what youre doing doesnt work for 50 years its time to try something new laughter and our shift in cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere it removes a phony excuse for restrictions in cuba it stands up for democratic values and extends the hand of friendship to the cuban people and this year congress should begin the work of ending the embargo  as his holiness pope francis has said diplomacy is the work of small steps and these small steps have added up to new hope for the future in cuba and after years in prison we are overjoyed that alan gross is back where he belongs welcome home alan were glad youre here  our diplomacy is at work with respect to iran where for the first time in a decade weve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material between now and this spring we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nucleararmed iran secures america and our allies including israel while avoiding yet another middle east conflict there are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed and i keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear iran  but new sanctions passed by this congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails alienating america from its allies making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that iran starts up its nuclear program again it doesnt make sense and thats why i will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress the american people expect us only to go to war as a last resort and i intend to stay true to that wisdom third were looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century no foreign nation no hacker should be able to shut down our networks steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of american families especially our kids so were making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats just as we have done to combat terrorism  and tonight i urge this congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks combat identity theft and protect our childrens information that should be a bipartisan effort if we dont act well leave our nation and our economy vulnerable if we do we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe  in west africa our troops our scientists our doctors our nurses our health care workers are rolling back ebola saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease i could not be prouder of them and i thank this congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts but the job is not yet done and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics invest in smart development and eradicate extreme poverty  in the asiapacific we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade how they resolve maritime disputes how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief and no challengeno challengeposes a greater threat to future generations than climate change  two thousand fourteen was the planets warmest year on record now 1 year doesnt make a trend but this does 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century  now ive heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying theyre not scientists that we dont have enough information to act well im not a scientist either but you know what i know a lot of really good scientistslaughterat nasa and at noaa and at our major universities and the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate and if we dont act forcefully well continue to see rising oceans longer hotter heat waves dangerous droughts and floods and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe the pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security we should act like it  and thats why over the past 6 years weve done more than ever to combat climate change from the way we produce energy to the way we use it thats why weve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history and thats why i will not let this congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts i am determined to make sure that american leadership drives international action  in beijing we made a historic announcement the united states will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution and china committed for the first time to limiting their emissions and because the worlds two largest economies came together other nations are now stepping up and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet weve got  and theres one last pillar of our leadership and thats the example of our values as americans we respect human dignity even when were threatened which is why i have prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained its why we speak out against the deplorable antisemitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world its why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of muslims the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace thats why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian gay bisexual or transgender we do these things not only because they are the right thing to do but because ultimately they will make us safer  as americans we have a profound commitment to justice so it makes no sense to spend 3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit since ive been president weve worked responsibly to cut the population of gitmo in half now it is time to finish the job and i will not relent in my determination to shut it down it is not who we are its time to close gitmo  as americans we cherish our civil liberties and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks so while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs i have not as promised our intelligence agencies have worked hard with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse and next month well issue a report on how were keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy  looking to the future instead of the past making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities leading always with the example of our valuesthats what makes us exceptional thats what keeps us strong thats why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards our own  you know just over a decade ago i gave a speech in boston where i said there wasnt a liberal america or a conservative america a black america or a white america but a united states of america i said this because i had seen it in my own life in a nation that gave someone like me a chance because i grew up in hawaii a melting pot of races and customs because i made illinois my home a state of small towns rich farmland one of the worlds great cities a microcosm of the country where democrats and republicans and independents good people of every ethnicity and every faith share certain bedrock values  over the past 6 years the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasnt delivered on this vision how ironic they say that our politics seems more divided than ever its held up as proof not just of my own flawsof which there are manybut also as proof that the vision itself is misguided naive that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it  i know how tempting such cynicism may be but i still think the cynics are wrong i still believe that we are one people i still believe that together we can do great things even when the odds are long  i believe this because over and over in my 6 years in office i have seen america at its best ive seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from new york to california and our newest officers at west point annapolis colorado springs new london ive mourned with grieving families in tucson and newtown in boston in west texas and west virginia ive watched americans beat back adversity from the gulf coast to the great plains from midwest assembly lines to the mid atlantic seaboard ive seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country a civil right now legal in states that 7 in 10 americans call home so i know the good and optimistic and bighearted generosity of the american people who every day live the idea that we are our brothers keeper and our sisters keeper and i know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example  so the question for those of us here tonight is how we all of us can better reflect americas hopes ive served in congress with many of you i know many of you well there are a lot of good people here on both sides of the aisle and many of you have told me that this isnt what you signed up for arguing past each other on cable shows the constant fundraising always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision  imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns imagine if we did something different understand a better politics isnt one where democrats abandon their agenda or republicans simply embrace mine a better politics is one where we appeal to each others basic decency instead of our basest fears a better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other where we talk issues and values and principles and facts rather than gotcha moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with peoples daily lives  a politicsa better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility asking them to join in the great mission of building america  if were going to have arguments lets have arguments but lets make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country we still may not agree on a womans right to choose but surely we can agree its a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing alltime lows and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs  yes passions still fly on immigration but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child and that its possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants ive talked to republicans and democrats about that thats something that we can share  we may go at it in campaign season but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred that its being denied to too many and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from selma to montgomery and the passage of the voting rights act we can come together democrats and republicans to make voting easier for every single american  we may have different takes on the events of ferguson and new york but surely we can understand a father who fears his son cant walk home without being harassed and surely we can understand the wife who wont rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift and surely we can agree that its a good thing that for the first time in 40 years the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together and use that as a starting point for democrats and republicans community leaders and law enforcement to reform americas criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us  thats a better politics thats how we start rebuilding trust thats how we move this country forward thats what the american people want and thats what they deserve  i have no more campaigns to run  at this point some audience members applauded  my only agendalaughter audience member inaudible  the president i know because i won both of them laughter my only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one ive had since the day i swore an oath on the steps of this capitol to do what i believe is best for america if you share the broad vision i outlined tonight i ask you to join me in the work at hand if you disagree with parts of it i hope youll at least work with me where you do agree and i commit to every republican here tonight that i will not only seek out your ideas i will seek to work with you to make this country stronger  because i want this chamber i want this city to reflect the truth that for all our blind spots and shortcomings we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides to unite in common effort to help our neighbors whether down the street or on the other side of the world  i want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood your life matters and we are committed to improving your life chances as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids i want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift that were a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen man and woman young and old black and white latino asian immigrant native american gay straight americans with mental illness or physical disability everybody matters i want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states that we are the united states of america  i want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her president with a story that sums up these past 6 years its amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to    we are a strong tightknit family whos made it through some very very hard times  my fellow americans we too are a strong tightknit family we too have made it through some hard times fifteen years into this new century we have picked ourselves up dusted ourselves off and begun again the work of remaking america we have laid a new foundation a brighter future is ours to write lets begin this new chapter together and lets start the work right now  thank you god bless you god bless this country we love thank you   
223, Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union, Barack Obama,2016-01-12,   thank you mr speaker mr vice president members of congress my fellow americans tonight marks the eighth year that ive come here to report on the state of the union and for this final one im going to try to make it a little shorter i know some of you are antsy to get back to iowa laughter ive been there ill be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips laughter  now i understand that because its an election season expectations for what we will achieve this year are low but mr speaker i appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families so i hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse so who knows we might surprise the cynics again  but tonight i want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead dont worry ive got plentylaughterfrom helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients and i will keep pushing for progress on the work that i believe still needs to be done fixing a broken immigration system protecting our kids from gun violence equal pay for equal work paid leave raising the minimum wage all these things still matter to hardworking families theyre still the right thing to do and i wont let up until they get done  but for my final address to this chamber i dont want to just talk about next year i want to focus on the next 5 years the next 10 years and beyond i want to focus on our future  we live in a time of extraordinary change change thats reshaping the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world its change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs but also economic disruptions that strain working families it promises this education for girls in the most remote villages but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away its change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality and whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate  america has been through big changes before wars and depression the influx of new immigrants workers fighting for a fair deal movements to expand civil rights each time there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control and each time we overcame those fears we did not in the words of lincoln adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past instead we thought anew and acted anew we made change work for us always extending americas promise outward to the next frontier to more people and because we did because we saw opportunity with awhere others saw peril we emerged stronger and better than before  what was true then can be true now our unique strengths as a nation our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of lawthese things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come  in fact its in that spirit that we have made progress these past 7 years thats how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations thats how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector thats how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans thats how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love  but such progress is not inevitable its the result of choices we make together and we face such choices right now will we respond to the changes of our time with fear turning inward as a nation turning against each other as a people or will we face the future with confidence in who we are in what we stand for in the incredible things that we can do together  so lets talk about the future and four big questions that i believe we as a country have to answer regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next congress first how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy second how do we make technology work for us and not against us especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change third how do we keep america safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman and finally how can we make our politics reflect whats best in us and not whats worst  let me start with the economy and a basic fact the united states of america right now has the strongest most durable economy in the world were in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history more than 14 million new jobs the strongest 2 years of job growth since the 1990s an unemployment rate cut in half our auto industry just had its best year ever thats just part of a manufacturing surge thats created nearly 900000 new jobs in the past 6 years and weve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost threequarters  anyone claiming that americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction now what is trueand the reason that a lot of americans feel anxiousis that the economy has been changing in profound ways changes that started long before the great recession hit changes that have not let up  today technology doesnt just replace jobs on the assembly line but any job where work can be automated companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition as a result workers have less leverage for a raise companies have less loyalty to their communities and more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top  all these trends have squeezed workers even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing its made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty harder for young people to start their careers tougher for workers to retire when they want to and although none of these trends are unique to america they do offend our uniquely american belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot  for the past 7 years our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody weve made progress but we need to make more and despite all the political arguments that weve had these past few years there are actually some areas where americans broadly agree  we agree that real opportunity requires every american to get the education and training they need to land a goodpaying job the bipartisan reform of no child left behind was an important start and together weve increased early childhood education lifted high school graduation rates to new highs boosted graduates in fields like engineering in the coming years we should build on that progress by providing prek for all and offering every student the handson computer science and math classes that make them jobready on day one we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids  and we have to make college affordable for every american no hard working student should be stuck in the red weve already reduced student loan payments byto 10 percent of a borrowers income and thats good but now weve actually got to cut the cost of college providing 2 years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that and im going to keep fighting to get that started this year its the right thing to do  but a great education isnt all we need in this new economy we also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security its not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber laughter for everyone else especially folks in their forties and fifties saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher americans understand that at some point in their careers in this new economy they may have to retool they may have to retrain but they shouldnt lose what theyve already worked so hard to build in the process  thats why social security and medicare are more important than ever we shouldnt weaken them we should strengthen them and for americans short of retirement basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today that by the way is what the affordable care act is all about its about filling the gaps in employerbased care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business youll still have coverage nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far and in the process health care inflation has slowed and our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law  now im guessing we wont agree on health care anytime soon but laughtera little applause back there laughter just a guess but there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security say a hardworking american loses his job we shouldnt just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business thats ready to hire him if that new job doesnt pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills and even if hes going from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him thats the way we make the new economy work better for everybody  i also know speaker ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty america is about giving everybody willing to work a chance a hand up and id welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support like expanding tax cuts for lowincome workers who dont have children  but there are some areas wherewe just have to be honestit has been difficult to find agreement over the last 7 years and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the systems not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations and its an honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make  i believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy i think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed there is redtape that needs to be cut applause there you go yes see but after years now of record corporate profits working families wont get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody elses expense middle class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street did immigrants arent the principal reason wages havent gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over longterm returns its sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts laughter  the point is i believe that in this new economy workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice not less the rules should work for them and im not alone in this this year i plan to lift up the many businesses who have figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders and i want to spread those best practices across america thats part of a brighter future  in fact it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative and this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges  sixty years ago when the russians beat us into space we didnt deny sputnik was up there laughter we didnt argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget we built a space program almost overnight and 12 years later we were walking on the moon  now that spirit of discovery is in our dna america is thomas edison and the wright brothers and george washington carver america is grace hopper and katherine johnson and sally ride america is every immigrant and entrepreneur from boston to austin to silicon valley racing to shape a better future thats who we are  and over the past 7 years weve nurtured that spirit weve protected an open internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and low income americans online weve launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day but we can do so much more  last year vice president biden said that with a new moonshot america can cure cancer last month he worked with this congress to give scientists at the national institutes of health the strongest resources that theyve had in over a decade wellso tonight im announcing a new national effort to get it done and because hes gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years im putting joe in charge of mission control for the loved ones weve all lost for the families that we can still save lets make america the country that cures cancer once and for all what do you say joe lets make it happen  now medical research is critical we need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources look if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it laughter you will be pretty lonely because youll be debating our military most of americas business leaders the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and 200 nations around the world who agree its a problem and intend to solve it but even if the planet wasnt at stake even if 2014 wasnt the warmest year on recorduntil 2015 turned out to be even hotterwhy would we want to pass up the chance for american businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future listen 7 years ago we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history here are the results in fields from iowa to texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier conventional power on rooftops from arizona to new york solar is saving americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more americans than coal in jobs that pay better than average were taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy something by the way that environmentalists and tea partiers have teamed up to support and meanwhile weve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on earth gas under 2 bucks a gallon aint bad either laughter  now weve got to accelerate the transition away from old dirtier energy sources rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels we do them no favor when we dont show them where the trends are going and thats why im going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet and that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of americans to work building a 21stcentury transportation system  now none of this is going to happen overnight and yes there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo but the jobs well create the money well save the planet well preserve that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve and its within our grasp  now climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world and thats why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep america safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nationbuild everywhere theres a problem  now i told you earlier all the talk of americas economic decline is political hot air well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and america getting weaker let me tell you something the united states of america is the most powerful nation on earth period applause period its not even close applause its not even close its not even close we spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world applause all right no nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know thats the path to ruin surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when i was elected to this office and when it comes to every important international issue people of the world do not look to beijing or moscow to lead they call us so i think its useful to level set here because when we dont we dont make good decisions  now as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing i know this is a dangerous time but thats not primarily because of some looming superpower out there and its certainly not because of diminished american strength in todays world were threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states  the middle east is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation rooted in conflicts that date back millennia economic headwinds are blowing in from a chinese economy that is in significant transition even as their economy severely contracts russia is pouring resources in to prop up ukraine and syria client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit and the international system we built after world war ii is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality its up to us the united states of america to help remake that system and to do that well it means that weve got to set priorities priority number one is protecting the american people and going after terrorist networks both al qaida and now isil pose a direct threat to our people because in todays world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life including their own can do a lot of damage they use the internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country their actions undermine and destabilize our allies we have to take them out  but as we focus on destroying isil overthetop claims that this is world war iii just play into their hands masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped but they do not threaten our national existence that is the story isil wants to tell thats the kind of propaganda they use to recruit we dont need to build them up to show that were serious and we sure dont need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that isil is somehow representative of one of the worlds largest religions we just need to call them what they are killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out hunted down and destroyed  and thats exactly what were doing for more than a year america has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off isils financing disrupt their plots stop the flow of terrorist fighters and stamp out their vicious ideology with nearly 10000 airstrikes were taking out their leadership their oil their training camps their weapons were training arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in iraq and syria  if this congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world authorize the use of military force against isil take a vote applause take a vote but the american people should know that with or without congressional action isil will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them if you doubt americas commitmentor mineto see that justice is done just ask usama bin laden ask the leader of al qaida in yemen who was taken out last year or the perpetrator of the benghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell when you come after americans we go after you and it may take time but we have long memories and our reach has no limits  our foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from isil and al qaida but it cant stop there for even without isil even without al qaida instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world in the middle east in afghanistan and parts of pakistan in parts of central america in africa and asia some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feeding the next wave of refugees the world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians that may work as a tv sound bite but it doesnt pass muster on the world stage  we also cant try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis even if its done with the best of intentions thats not leadership thats a recipe for quagmire spilling american blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us its the lesson of vietnam its the lesson of iraq and we should have learned it by now  now fortunately there is a smarter approach a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power it says america will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight thats our approach to conflicts like syria where were partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace thats why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled diplomacy to prevent a nucleararmed iran and as we speak iran has rolled back its nuclear program shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war   thats how we stopped the spread of ebola in west africa our military our doctors our development workersthey were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic hundreds of thousands maybe a couple million lives were saved  thats how we forged a transpacific partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance american leadership in asia it cuts 18000 taxes on products made in america which will then support more good jobs here in america with tpp china does not set the rules in that region we do you want to show our strength in this new century approve this agreement give us the tools to enforce it its the right thing to do  let me give you another example fifty years of isolating cuba had failed to promote democracy it set us back in latin america thats why we restored diplomatic relations opened the door to travel and commerce positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the cuban people so if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the cold war is over lift the embargo  the point is american leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the worldexcept when we kill terrorists or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right it means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charity  when we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that helps vulnerable countries but it also protects our kids when we help ukraine defend its democracy or colombia resolve a decadeslong war that strengthens the international order we depend on when we help african countries feed their people and care for the sick its the right thing to do and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores right now were on track to end the scourge of hivaids thats within our grasp and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria something ill be pushing this congress to fund this year  thats american strength thats american leadership and that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example thats why i will keep working to shut down the prison at guantanamo it is expensive it is unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies theres a better way  and thats why we need to reject any politicsany politicsthat targets people because of race or religion let me just say this this is not a matter of political correctness this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong the world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith  his holiness pope francis told this body from the very spot that im standing on tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place when politicians insult muslims whether abroad or our fellow citizens when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names that doesnt make us safer thats not telling it whattelling it like it is its just wrong it diminishes us in the eyes of the world it makes it harder to achieve our goals it betrays who we are as a country we the people our constitution begins with those three simple words words weve come to recognize mean all the people not just some words that insist we rise and fall together that thats how we might perfect our union and that brings me to the fourth and maybe most important thing that i want to say tonight  the future we wantall of us wantopportunity and security for our families a rising standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for our kidsall that is within our reach but it will only happen if we work together it will only happen if we can have rational constructive debates it will only happen if we fix our politics  a better politics doesnt mean we have to agree on everything this is a big country different regions different attitudes different interests thats one of our strengths too our founders distributed power between states and branches of government and expected us to argue just as they did fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relations over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security  but democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens it doesnt work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice it doesnt work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken america democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention and most of all democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesnt matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest  too many americans feel that way right now its one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better i have no doubt a president with the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and i guarantee ill keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office  but my fellow americans this cannot be my taskor any presidents alone there are a whole lot of folks in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected by the noise coming out of your base i know youve told me its the worst kept secret in washington and a lot of you arent enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor  but that means if we want a better politicsand im addressing the american people nowif we want a better politics its not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president we have to change the system to reflect our better selves  i think weve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around let a bipartisan group do it  i believe weve got to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests cant bankroll our elections and if our existing approach to campaign finance reform cant pass muster in the courts we need to work together to find a real solution because its a problem and most of you dont like raising money laughter i know ive done it  weve got to make it easier to vote not harder we need to modernize it for the way we live now this is america we want to make it easier for people to participate and over the course of this year i intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that but i cant do these things on my own changes in our political processin not just who gets elected but how they get electedthat will only happen when the american people demand it it depends on you thats whats meant by a government of by and for the people  what im suggesting is hard its a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is all the folks who are elected dont care and to believe that our voices and our actions dont matter but if we give up now then we forsake a better future those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of americans have fought even died to secure and then as frustration grows there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes to scapegoat fellow citizens who dont look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background  we cant afford to go down that path it wont deliver the economy we want it will not produce the security we want but most of all it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world  so my fellow americans whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for others especially the weak especially the vulnerable knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us we need every american to stay active in our public lifeand not just during election timeso that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that i see in the american people every single day  it is not easy our brand of democracy is hard but i can promise that a little over a year from now when i no longer hold this office i will be right there with you as a citizen inspired by those voices of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped america travel so far voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or asian or latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native born not democrat or republican but as americans first bound by a common creed voices dr king believed would have the final word voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love  and theyre out there those voices they dont get a lot of attention they dont seek a lot of fanfare but theyre busy doing the work this country needs doing i see them everywhere i travel in this incredible country of ours i see you the american people and in your daily acts of citizenship i see our future unfolding  i see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off i see it in the dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early maybe with some extra supplies that she bought because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease  i see it in the american who served his time made bad mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over and i see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance the protester determined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the beat treating everybody with respect doing the brave quiet work of keeping us safe  i see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon the community that lines up to cheer him on its the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything hes been taught  i see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth  thats the america i know thats the country we love clear eyed big hearted undaunted by challenge optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word thats what makes me so hopeful about our future i believe in change because i believe in you the american people and thats why i stand here as confident as i have ever been that the state of our union is strong  thank you god bless you god bless the united states of america thank you
