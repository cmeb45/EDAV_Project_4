# EDAV Project 4: Text Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing State of the Union speeches of US presidents between 1970 and 2016. We used cosine similarity and hierarchical clustering as measures of how similar speeches were to each other, with each president's speech being closest to their other speeches. Speech complexity, or how well the text can be understood, was observed for each address using the Coleman-Liau readablity score, with Republican presidents having higher scores on average than Democrats.
